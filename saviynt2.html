<div>Q3.Anitha, a manager, has a large number of users reporting to her, with most of them working remotely.</br>
Which of the following Campaign Types would you recommend for this scenario to reduce certification fatigue for Anitha?</br>
A. Launch User Manager Campaign and then Self Certification Campaign on certified items</br>
B. Launch Application Owner Campaign and then Self Certification Campaign on certified items</br>
C. Launch a Self Certification Campaign and then User Manager Campaign on certified items</br>
D. Launch Service Account Campaign and then User Manager Campaign on certified items</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_003"/>
<div class="hidden_show_003">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To reduce certification fatigue for Anitha, a manager with a large number of remote users, the recommended approach is C. Launch a Self Certification Campaign and then User Manager Campaign on certified items. Here's the rationale:</br>
</br>
Self Certification Campaign:</br>
</br>
Purpose: Allows users to review and certify their own access.</br>
</br>
Benefits for this scenario:</br>
</br>
Reduces Manager Burden: Shifts the initial review responsibility from Anitha to the individual users, who are most familiar with their own access needs.</br>
</br>
Scalability: Well-suited for large, distributed teams, as it doesn't rely solely on the manager's capacity.</br>
</br>
Empowerment: Gives users more control over their access and promotes a culture of accountability.</br>
</br>
User Manager Campaign on Certified Items:</br>
</br>
Purpose: Allows managers to review and certify their subordinates' access.</br>
</br>
Benefits when combined with Self Certification:</br>
</br>
Focus on Exceptions: Anitha can focus her review on items that were not self-certified or that require further scrutiny after the initial self-certification.</br>
</br>
Reduced Volume: The volume of items Anitha needs to review is significantly reduced, as users have already certified their own access.</br>
</br>
Increased Efficiency: Streamlines the manager's review process, making it more manageable and less time-consuming.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
A . Launch User Manager Campaign and then Self Certification Campaign on certified items: This sequence is less effective because it puts the burden on the manager first, potentially leading to fatigue.</br>
</br>
B . Launch Application Owner Campaign and then Self Certification Campaign on certified items: Application Owner campaigns are not relevant to a manager's review of their subordinates' access.</br>
</br>
D . Launch Service Account Campaign and then User Manager Campaign on certified items: Service Account campaigns are for reviewing service accounts, not user access.</br>

<div>Q4.Jane was managing an AD Group; however, she had to decommission this group and revoke access for all the users.</br>
Which of the following options should be used to perform the above task?</br>
A.Segregation of Duties</br>
B.Entitlement Update Rule</br>
C.Mitigation Control</br>
D.Entitlement Owner Certification</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_004"/>
<div class="hidden_show_004">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
To decommission an AD Group and revoke access for all users, Jane should use D. Entitlement Owner Certification. Here is why:</br>
</br>
AD Group as an Entitlement: In Saviynt, an AD Group is typically represented as an Entitlement.</br>
</br>
Entitlement Owner Certification: This type of campaign allows the designated owner of an entitlement (in this case, Jane, as the manager of the AD Group) to review and certify who should have access to that entitlement.</br>
</br>
Revoking Access: As the Entitlement Owner, Jane can use the certification campaign to:</br>
</br>
Review the list of users: See all users who are currently members of the AD Group.</br>
</br>
Revoke access for all users: Mark all users for removal from the group.</br>
</br>
Decommissioning the Group: After revoking access for all users through the certification, Jane can then proceed with decommissioning the AD Group itself (either through Saviynt if it manages AD group lifecycle or directly in Active Directory).</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
A . Segregation of Duties: SoD is a principle, not a specific action for revoking access.</br>
</br>
B . Entitlement Update Rule: While rules can automate some actions, a certification campaign provides a more controlled and auditable way to review and revoke access, especially for a sensitive action like decommissioning a group.</br>
</br>
C . Mitigation Control: Mitigation controls are used to manage SoD conflicts, not for revoking access to entitlements.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: An Entitlement Owner Certification campaign provides a structured and auditable way for Jane to review the membership of the AD Group, revoke access for all users, and prepare for the group's decommissioning, aligning with best practices for access management.</br>

<div>Q5.Which of the following options can a Campaign Owner use to view the Entitlements Query that was used in a previously launched Campaign?</br>
A.Reconfigure option</br>
B.Campaign Export</br>
C.Campaign Summary</br>
D.Export option at the top right corner of the page, next to the Refresh Progress option</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_005"/>
<div class="hidden_show_005">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To view the Entitlements Query used in a previously launched Campaign in Saviynt, a Campaign Owner can use the C. Campaign Summary. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Campaign Summary: The Campaign Summary provides a detailed overview of a campaign's configuration, including:</br>
</br>
Campaign Scope: The users, applications, or entitlements included in the campaign.</br>
</br>
Filters and Queries: Any filters or queries used to define the campaign scope, including the Entitlements Query.</br>
</br>
Certifier Information: Details about the assigned certifiers.</br>
</br>
Schedule: The campaign's start and end dates.</br>
</br>
Status: The current status of the campaign (e.g., Active, Completed, Expired).</br>
</br>
Accessing the Entitlements Query: The Campaign Summary typically includes a section that displays the exact query used to select the entitlements included in the campaign.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
A . Reconfigure option: While you might be able to see the query by going into the reconfiguration, it's not the most direct way. The Campaign Summary is designed to provide this information readily.</br>
</br>
B . Campaign Export: Exporting the campaign data might include the list of entitlements but not necessarily the original query used to select them.</br>
</br>
D . Export option at the top right corner of the page, next to the Refresh Progress option: This option typically exports the current view of the campaign data, not the underlying configuration details like the Entitlements Query.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: The Campaign Summary in Saviynt is the most direct and convenient place for a Campaign Owner to review the detailed configuration of a campaign, including the Entitlements Query used to define the campaign's scope.</br>

<div>Q6.The process of Attestation(認証) or Certification can be best described as:</br>
A.Segregation of Duties</br>
B.Access Reviews</br>
C.Access Request</br>
D.Application Onboarding</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_006"/>
<div class="hidden_show_006">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The process of Attestation or Certification in the context of Saviynt can be best described as B . Access Reviews. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Attestation/Certification: These terms are often </br>
used interchangeably(交換可能に) in the context of identity governance. </br>
They refer to the process of formally reviewing and approving or revoking user access rights.</br>
</br>
Access Reviews: This is the broader term that encompasses the entire process of periodically reviewing user access to ensure it is appropriate and aligned with business needs and security policies. Attestation and Certification are specific actions performed within an access review.</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Campaigns: Saviynt's campaigns are designed to facilitate and manage access reviews.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
A . Segregation of Duties: SoD is a principle that aims to prevent fraud and errors by dividing critical tasks among different individuals. While access reviews can help enforce SoD, they are not the same thing.</br>
</br>
C . Access Request: This is the process of requesting access to resources, which is a separate process from reviewing existing access.</br>
</br>
D . Application Onboarding: This is the process of integrating an application into Saviynt, which is a prerequisite for access reviews but not the review process itself.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: Attestation or Certification, as performed within Saviynt campaigns, are integral parts of the broader process of Access Reviews, which aim to ensure that user access is appropriate, authorized, and aligned with security policies.</br>
</br>

<div>Q7.An Application Owner Campaign can have multiple primary Certifiers and a single secondary Certifier.</br>
A.True</br>
B.False</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_007"/>
<div class="hidden_show_007">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The statement 'An Application Owner Campaign can have multiple primary Certifiers(証明する) and a single secondary Certifier' is generally False in Saviynt. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Application Owner Campaign: This campaign type is designed for Application Owners to review and certify access to their applications.</br>
</br>
Primary Certifier: There is usually a single designated Application Owner for each application. This is because application ownership is typically a single point of accountability. While it is technically possible to assign multiple owners, it is not considered a best practice.</br>
</br>
Secondary Certifiers (Backup/Delegates): Application Owner Campaigns can have multiple secondary certifiers. These are often used as:</br>
</br>
Backup: To ensure the campaign can proceed if the primary certifier is unavailable.</br>
</br>
Delegates: To allow the primary certifier to delegate some of the certification tasks.</br>
</br>
Consultants: Other stakeholders, such as security or compliance teams, who can be consulted during the decision-making process.</br>
</br>
Why the Statement Is Generally False: The core principle of application ownership implies a single point of accountability. While multiple secondary certifiers can assist, having multiple primary certifiers can lead to confusion and conflicting decisions.</br>
</br>
Possible Exceptions (Less Common):</br>
</br>
Highly Customized Configurations: In some very specific scenarios, organizations might customize Saviynt to allow multiple primary certifiers for an application, but this is not a standard or recommended practice.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q8.Given that an Admin launched a Role Ownership Campaign for you, which of the following options can you not certify?</br>
A.Role Ownership</br>
B.User membership of the Role</br>
C.Delete Role</br>
D.Associated Entitlements</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_008"/>
<div class="hidden_show_008">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
Given that an Admin launched a Role Ownership Campaign for you in Saviynt, the option you can not certify is A. Role Ownership. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Role Ownership Campaign: This type of campaign is specifically designed for reviewing and certifying the ownership of roles, not the other aspects of a role.</br>
</br>
Your Role as Certifier: In this scenario, you are the designated reviewer for role ownership. This means you are responsible for confirming who should be the owner of specific roles.</br>
</br>
What You Can Certify in a Role Ownership Campaign:</br>
</br>
Confirm or Change Role Owner: You can confirm that the current role owner is correct or assign a new owner.</br>
</br>
What You Cannot Certify in This Campaign:</br>
</br>
A . Role Ownership: You are the one certifying role ownership, so you cannot certify your own action of assigning an owner. It would be a circular process.</br>
</br>
B . User membership of the Role: This is typically reviewed in a User Access Campaign or a Role Membership Campaign.</br>
</br>
C . Delete Role: Role deletion is an administrative action, not typically part of a Role Ownership Campaign.</br>
</br>
D . Associated Entitlements: Entitlement certification is usually handled in an Entitlement Owner Campaign or as part of a broader User Access Campaign.</br>
</br>
In essence: A Role Ownership Campaign focuses solely on validating and assigning role owners. Other aspects of role management, such as user membership or associated entitlements, are handled in different campaign types or through separate administrative actions. As the certifier in this specific campaign, you cannot certify the very action you are performing, which is assigning role ownership.

<div>Q9.What is a Campaign?</br>
A.Group of similar Endpoints</br>
B.Group of User Groups</br>
C.Group of Dashboards</br>
D.Group of similar Certifications</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_009"/>
<div class="hidden_show_009">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
In Saviynt, a Campaign is best described as a D. Group of similar Certifications. Here's a breakdown:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Campaigns and Certifications:</br>
</br>
Campaign: A container that defines the scope, schedule, participants, and other settings for a set of related access certifications.</br>
</br>
Certification: The individual review task assigned to a Certifier (e.g., a manager reviewing their subordinates' access, an application owner reviewing users of their application).</br>
</br>
Analogy: Think of a Campaign as a project, and Certifications as individual tasks within that project.</br>
</br>
Purpose of Campaigns: Campaigns provide a structured way to manage and track access reviews, ensuring that they are conducted regularly and consistently.</br>
</br>
Examples of Campaigns:</br>
</br>
User Manager Campaign: Groups certifications where managers review their subordinates' access.</br>
</br>
Entitlement Owner Campaign: Groups certifications where entitlement owners review who has access to their entitlements.</br>
</br>
Application Owner Campaign: Groups certifications where application owners review who has access to their applications.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Incorrect:</br>
</br>
A . Group of similar Endpoints: Endpoints are systems or applications connected to Saviynt, not the primary grouping within a campaign.</br>
</br>
B . Group of User Groups: User groups are collections of users, not the defining element of a campaign.</br>
</br>
C . Group of Dashboards: Dashboards provide visualizations of data, but they are not the core component of a campaign.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: A Campaign in Saviynt is essentially a container for a set of related access certifications, providing a framework for managing and organizing the review process based on specific criteria and objectives.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q10.Which of the following Account statuses is not considered in a User Manager Campaign certification?</br>
A.Manually Suspended</br>
B.Inactive</br>
C.Suspended from Import Service</br>
D.Manually Provisioned</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_010"/>
<div class="hidden_show_010">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
The Account status that is not typically considered in a User Manager Campaign certification in Saviynt is D. </br>
Manually Provisioned. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's User Manager Campaign Focus: User Manager Campaigns primarily focus on reviewing </br>
and certifying access that is actively managed and tracked within Saviynt.</br>
</br>
Account Statuses and Their Relevance:</br>
</br>
A . Manually Suspended: Indicates an account that has been intentionally disabled within Saviynt.</br>
These accounts are often included in reviews to ensure the suspension is still valid.</br>
B . Inactive: Indicates an account that has not been used for a certain period.</br>
These accounts are often included in reviews to determine if they should be disabled or removed.</br>
C . Suspended from Import Service: Indicates an account that has been suspended due to </br>
issues during an import process. These accounts are typically reviewed to </br>
resolve the import problem and determine the appropriate account status.</br>
</br>
Manually Provisioned Accounts: These accounts are created directly in the target system, </br>
bypassing Saviynt's provisioning processes. As such, they might not be fully tracked or managed within Saviynt.</br>
</br>
Out-of-Band Access: Manually provisioned accounts represent a form of out-of-band access, </br>
which is often excluded from standard User Manager Campaigns.</br>
</br>
Separate Review Process: Organizations might have separate processes for </br>
reviewing manually provisioned accounts, such as using the RevokeOutOfBandAccessJob or a different type of campaign.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: While other account statuses like Manually Suspended, Inactive, </br>
and Suspended from Import Service are relevant to access management within Saviynt </br>
and are often included in User Manager Campaigns, Manually Provisioned accounts </br>
might be excluded because they represent access granted outside of Saviynt's control </br>
and might require a different review process.

<div>Q11.There is a requirement to have multiple users as Campaign Owners for a User Manager Campaign.</br>
Which of the following configurations would be appropriate to achieve this?</br>
A.Create a user Query and add users</br>
B.Create a user group and choose the user group as the Campaign Owner</br>
C.Create a Roles Query and add Roles of various users</br>
D.Create an Organization Query and add users</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_011"/>
<div class="hidden_show_011">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
To have multiple users as Campaign Owners for a User Manager Campaign in Saviynt, </br>
the appropriate configuration is to B. Create a user group and choose </br>
the user group as the Campaign Owner. Here's the explanation:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's User Groups: User groups are collections of users that can be used for </br>
various purposes, including assigning roles, permissions, and ownership.</br>
</br>
Campaign Owner as a User Group: Saviynt allows you to specify a user group </br>
as the owner of a campaign. This means that all members of the group will have the same campaign ownership permissions.</br>
</br>
Benefits of Using a User Group:</br>
</br>
Simplified Management: It's easier to manage a group of users than to assign individual users as campaign owners.</br>
</br>
Flexibility: You can easily add or remove users from the group to adjust campaign ownership as needed.</br>
</br>
Shared Responsibility: All members of the group share responsibility for managing the campaign.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
A . Create a user Query and add users: While you can use queries to select users, </br>
directly using a user group is a more standard and manageable approach for assigning multiple campaign owners.</br>
C . Create a Roles Query and add Roles of various users: Roles are typically used for </br>
granting access rights, not for defining campaign ownership.</br>
D . Create an Organization Query and add users: Organization queries are related </br>
to the organizational structure and are not the best way to define a group of campaign owners.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: Using a user group as the Campaign Owner </br>
in Saviynt provides a flexible and manageable way to assign multiple users as owners, </br>
simplifying administration and promoting shared responsibility for campaign management.</br>

<div>Q12.A Campaign Owner can create various types of a User Manager Campaign to save </br>
different settings for various categories of Manager Access Reviews.</br>
A.Global Configurations</br>
B.Campaign Types</br>
C.Campaign Templates</br>
D.Campaign Previews</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_012"/>
<div class="hidden_show_012">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To save different settings for various categories of Manager Access Reviews </br>
within User Manager Campaigns, a Campaign Owner can create C. Campaign Templates. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Campaign Templates: Templates allow you to pre-configure various settings </br>
for a campaign and save them as a reusable template. This includes settings related to:</br>
</br>
Campaign Scope: Defining which users, applications, or entitlements are included.</br>
</br>
Certifier Selection: Specifying the type of certifiers (e.g., Managers, Application Owners).</br>
</br>
Scheduling and Notifications: Setting up the campaign schedule and email notifications.</br>
</br>
Advanced Configurations: Including filters, risk scores, and other advanced settings.</br>
</br>
Multiple Templates for Different Categories: A Campaign Owner can create multiple templates,</br>
each tailored to a specific category of Manager Access Review. For example:</br>
</br>
Template 1: For high-risk applications, with stricter filters and more frequent reviews.</br>
</br>
Template 2: For low-risk applications, with broader scope and less frequent reviews.</br>
</br>
Template 3: For specific departments or business units, with customized certifier selection.</br>
</br>
Benefits of Using Templates:</br>
</br>
Consistency: Ensures that similar types of reviews are conducted consistently.</br>
</br>
Efficiency: Saves time by eliminating the need to configure each campaign from scratch.</br>
</br>
Reduced Errors: Minimizes the risk of manual configuration errors.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
A . Global Configurations: Global configurations apply to all campaigns, </br>
not to specific categories of reviews.</br>
B . Campaign Types: Campaign types (e.g., User Manager, Entitlement Owner) </br>
define the overall purpose of the campaign, not the specific settings for different categories within a campaign type.</br>
</br>
D . Campaign Previews: Previews are for reviewing the campaign data before launch, </br>
not for saving different configurations.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: Campaign Templates in Saviynt provide a powerful way </br>
to save and reuse different configurations for various categories of </br>
Manager Access Reviews, promoting consistency, efficiency, and accuracy in the certification process.</br>

<div>Q13.As an Admin, you are required to set up an Entitlement Owner Campaign </br>
for Entitlements belonging to an Oracle ERP Endpoint by the Internal Audit team. </br>
The Campaign should be launched at the beginning of every month, and only Accounts </br>
and Entitlements that meet the prerequisites should be included in the Campaign.</br>
</br>
Which of the following 2-key configurations would you recommend for achieving this?</br>
A.Use Campaign Template and the Schedule Later option</br>
B.Use Advanced Configurations and Preview mode and create the Campaign at the beginning of each month</br>
C.Use Advanced Configurations and set the Campaign expiry to 31 days</br>
D.Cannot be achieved</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_013"/>
<div class="hidden_show_013">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
To set up an Entitlement Owner Campaign for Entitlements belonging to </br>
an Oracle ERP Endpoint that launches at the beginning of every month, and </br>
includes only Accounts and Entitlements that meet the prerequisites, </br>
the 2-key configurations you should recommend are A . Use Campaign Template and </br>
the Schedule Later option. Here's a breakdown:</br>
</br>
Campaign Template:</br>
</br>
Purpose: Templates allow you to save a set of campaign configurations as </br>
a reusable template. This is ideal for recurring campaigns with consistent settings.</br>
</br>
Benefits: Using a template saves time and ensures consistency across multiple campaign instances. </br>
You can define the scope (Oracle ERP Endpoint), Certifier type (Entitlement Owners), </br>
and other settings within the template.</br>
</br>
Prerequisites: You can include logic within the template to filter for Accounts and</br>
 Entitlements that meet the defined prerequisites.</br>
</br>
Schedule Later option:</br>
</br>
Purpose: This option allows you to schedule the campaign to launch at a specific date and time in the future.</br>
</br>
Recurring Scheduling: You can configure the campaign to run on a recurring schedule, such as the beginning of every month.</br>
</br>
Automation: This automates the campaign launch process, eliminating the need for manual intervention each month.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
B . Use Advanced Configurations and Preview mode and create the Campaign at the beginning </br>
of each month: This approach is manual and prone to errors. It doesn't leverage the automation benefits of templates and scheduling.</br>
</br>
C . Use Advanced Configurations and set the Campaign expiry to 31 days: </br>
While setting an expiry is important, it doesn't address the need for recurring monthly launches </br>
or using a template for consistent configuration.</br>
</br>
D . Cannot be achieved: This is incorrect; the scenario can be easily </br>
achieved using Campaign Templates and the Schedule Later option.
</div></br>



<div>Q14.Which of the following actions is appropriate if the data displayed </br>
in the Campaign Preview mode does not meet the requirement?</br>
A.Re-configure Campaign</br>
B.Check Summary</br>
C.Export Campaign</br>
D.Activate Campaign</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_014"/>
<div class="hidden_show_014">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
If the data displayed in the Campaign Preview mode does not meet the requirement </br>
in Saviynt, the appropriate action is A. Re-configure Campaign. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Campaign Preview Mode: This mode allows administrators to </br>
review the data that will be included in a campaign before activating it. </br>
It's a crucial step for ensuring that the campaign scope, data, and configuration are correct.</br>
</br>
Purpose of Preview Mode: The primary purpose of the preview is </br>
to identify any issues or discrepancies in the campaign setup before it goes live.</br>
</br>
Re-configure Campaign: If the preview reveals problems (e.g., incorrect users or </br>
entitlements are included, the wrong Certifiers are assigned, </br>
filters are not working as expected), the administrator needs </br>
to go back and re-configure the campaign settings. This might involve:</br>
</br>
Adjusting the campaign scope.</br>
</br>
Modifying filters or selection criteria.</br>
</br>
Changing Certifier assignments.</br>
</br>
Updating the campaign schedule or notifications.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Incorrect:</br>
</br>
B . Check Summary: The summary provides a high-level overview of the campaign,</br>
 but it doesn't allow for detailed data review like the preview mode.</br>
</br>
C . Export Campaign: Exporting the campaign data won't fix the underlying configuration issues.</br>
</br>
D . Activate Campaign: Activating a campaign with incorrect data would lead </br>
to inaccurate certification decisions and potential security risks.</br>
</div></br>




<div>Q15.To help users make informed and quick decisions, </br>
Saviynt provides filters for retrieving Certification data </br>
in the User Manager Campaign and Service Account Campaign.</br>
</br>
Which of the following options cannot be regarded as a Smart Filter?</br>
A.User's Assigned Role counts</br>
B.Access with SoD Violations</br>
C.Out-of-Band Access for Entitlements</br>
D.Risk Level for Accounts</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_015"/>
<div class="hidden_show_015">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The option that cannot be regarded as a Smart Filter in </br>
Saviynt's User Manager and Service Account Campaigns is A. User's Assigned Role counts. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Smart Filters: Smart Filters are pre-defined filters </br>
in Saviynt that help Certifiers quickly focus on specific access patterns </br>
or risk indicators during a certification campaign. They are designed </br>
to highlight potentially problematic or high-risk access.</br>
</br>
Examples of Smart Filters:</br>
</br>
B . Access with SoD Violations: This is a Smart Filter </br>
because it highlights access that violates Segregation of Duties policies, a significant risk indicator.</br>
</br>
C . Out-of-Band Access for Entitlements: This is a Smart Filter </br>
as it identifies access that was granted outside of the normal Saviynt processes, </br>
potentially indicating a security risk.</br>
</br>
D . Risk Level for Accounts: This is a Smart Filter </br>
because it allows Certifiers to focus on accounts with high-risk levels, which might require more scrutiny.</br>
</br>
Why 'User's Assigned Role counts' Is Not a Smart Filter:</br>
</br>
Not a Risk Indicator: Simply knowing the number of roles assigned </br>
to a user doesn't inherently indicate a risk or a specific access pattern </br>
that requires attention. A user might have many roles legitimately, </br>
or they might have few roles but with high-risk access.</br>
</br>
Not Actionable: This information alone doesn't provide enough context </br>
for a Certifier to make an informed decision about whether to approve or revoke access.</br>
</br>
Alternative: While not a 'Smart Filter', the number of roles assigned </br>
could be a data point displayed within the campaign, </br>
but it wouldn't be considered a pre-defined filter for highlighting risks.</br>
</div></br>







<div>Q16.Which of the following configurations can be used to allow Certifiers to certify their own access?</br>
A.Certify all users by default</br>
B.Show consult for own access</br>
C.Allow Self Certification</br>
D.Certification reassignment</br>
</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_016"/>
<div class="hidden_show_016">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
The configuration that can be used to allow Certifiers </br>
to certify their own access in a Saviynt Campaign is C. Allow Self Certification. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Campaign Configuration: Saviynt provides various configuration options </br>
to control the behavior of certification campaigns, including how self-certification is handled.</br>
</br>
'Allow Self Certification': This specific setting, when enabled, permits Certifiers </br>
to review and certify their own access within the campaign.</br>
</br>
Security Considerations: While enabling self-certification can streamline the process, </br>
it also introduces a potential security risk.</br>
 Organizations should carefully consider their risk tolerance and </br>
compliance requirements before enabling this option.</br>
</br>
Alternative Approaches: To mitigate the risks of self-certification, organizations might consider:</br>
</br>
Requiring additional approvals: Adding a second level of approval for self-certified items.</br>
</br>
Close monitoring: Implementing stricter monitoring and auditing of self-certified access.</br>
</br>
Disabling self-certification: In high-security environments, self-certification might be prohibited altogether.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
A . Certify all users by default: This setting is not directly related to self-certification.</br>

B . Show consult for own access: This option usually allows a certifier </br>
to consult with another user before making a decision, but doesn't enable self certification.</br>
</br>
D . Certification reassignment: This allows for reassigning certification tasks </br>
to other users, but doesn't directly address self-certification.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: The 'Allow Self Certification' </br>
setting in a Saviynt campaign configuration directly controls </br>
whether Certifiers can certify their own access, providing flexibility</br>
 but requiring careful consideration of the associated security implications.</br>

<div>Q17.Which of the following Jobs is responsible for configuring a dashboard in a Campaign?</br>
A.Campaign Export Job</br>
B.Create or Schedule Attestation Job</br>
C.Campaign Import Job</br>
D.Upgrade Job</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_017"/>
<div class="hidden_show_017">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The Job responsible for configuring a dashboard (among other configurations) </br>
in a Saviynt Campaign is B. Create or Schedule Attestation Job. Here's a detailed explanation:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Campaigns: Campaigns in Saviynt are used for access certification, </br>
allowing reviewers (Certifiers) to review and approve or revoke user access.</br>
</br>
Create or Schedule Attestation Job: This job is the core mechanism for creating </br>
and configuring various aspects of a campaign, including:</br>
</br>
Campaign Scope: Defining which users, entitlements, or resources are included in the campaign.</br>
</br>
Certifier Selection: Specifying who will be the reviewers for the campaign.</br>
</br>
Scheduling: Setting the start and end dates for the campaign.</br>
</br>
Notifications: Configuring email notifications for Certifiers and other stakeholders.</br>
</br>
Dashboard Configuration: Defining the information and layout displayed on </br>
the campaign dashboard for Certifiers. This includes selecting which data points, </br>
charts, and filters are visible.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Incorrect:</br>
</br>
A . Campaign Export Job: This job is used to export campaign data, not to configure the campaign itself.</br>
</br>
C . Campaign Import Job: This job is used to import data into a campaign, typically from an external source.</br>
</br>
D . Upgrade Job: This job is related to upgrading the Saviynt platform, not to campaign configuration.</br>
</br>
In summary: The 'Create or Schedule Attestation Job' is the central job for setting up </br>
and configuring all aspects of a Saviynt campaign, including the dashboard that</br>
 provides Certifiers with a summarized view of the certification data.</br>
</div></br>





<div>Q18.Which of the following features best describe the Authorization mechanism for the EIC application?</br>
A.Security System</br>
B.SSO</br>
C.WSRETRY Job</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_017"/>
<div class="hidden_show_017">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The feature that best describes the Authorization mechanism </br>
for the EIC (Enterprise Identity Cloud) application in Saviynt is A. Security System. Here's an explanation:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Security System: This is the core component within Saviynt that</br>
 handles authentication and authorization for various applications and resources, including EIC.</br>
</br>
Authorization in EIC: The Security System determines what actions users are allowed to perform within EIC, such as:</br>
</br>
Creating, updating, or deleting users.</br>
</br>
Managing roles and entitlements.</br>
</br>
Running reports.</br>
</br>
Configuring connections.</br>
</br>
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The Security System typically uses RBAC </br>
to manage these permissions. Users are assigned to roles, and roles are granted specific permissions within EIC.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Relevant:</br>
</br>
B . SSO (Single Sign-On): SSO is an authentication mechanism that allows users </br>
to log in once and access multiple applications. While Saviynt supports SSO, </br>
it's not the primary authorization mechanism for EIC.</br>
</br>
C . WSRETRY Job: This is a job related to retrying web service calls, not authorization.</br>

<div>Q19.The following USER_IMPORT_MAPPING attribute is set up in Workday RAAS connection:</br>
USER_IMPORT_MAPPING</br>
</br>
{</br>
</br>
'ImportType': 'RAAS',</br>
</br>
'ResponsePath': 'wd:Report_Data.wd:Report_Entry',</br>
</br>
'ImportMapping': {</br>
</br>
'USERNAME': 'wd:User_Name~#~string',</br>
</br>
'SYSTEMUSERNAME': 'wd:User_Name~#~string',</br>
</br>
'FIRSTNAME': 'wd:First_Name~#~string',</br>
</br>
'CITY': 'wd:Location.wd:Descriptor~#~string'</br>
</br>
}</br>
</br>
}</br>
</br>
As per the above mapping, USERNAME is the user attribute defined in Workday,</br>
 and User_Name is the attribute defined in EIC.</br>
</br>
A.True</br>
B.False</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_019"/>
<div class="hidden_show_019">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The statement is False. In the provided USER_IMPORT_MAPPING, </br>
USERNAME is the user attribute defined in EIC (Enterprise Identity Cloud), </br>
and wd:User_Name is the attribute defined in Workday. Here's a breakdown:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's USER_IMPORT_MAPPING: This configuration </br>
within a connection (in this case, Workday RAAS) defines </br>
how data from the connected system (Workday) should be mapped to attributes within Saviynt's EIC.</br>
</br>
ImportMapping: This section specifies the mapping between source attributes (Workday) and target attributes (EIC).</br>
</br>
USERNAME: In the provided mapping, USERNAME (without the wd: prefix) is </br>
the target attribute, meaning it's an attribute within Saviynt's EIC.</br>
</br>
wd:User_Name: The wd: prefix typically indicates a Workday attribute.</br>
 Therefore, wd:User_Name is the source attribute from Workday.</br>
</br>
~#~string: This likely indicates the data type of the attribute (string in this case).</br>
</br>
Correct Interpretation: The mapping is saying: </br>
'Take the value of the wd:User_Name attribute from Workday and map it to the USERNAME attribute in EIC.'</br>
</br>
In essence: The USER_IMPORT_MAPPING defines how data from </br>
Workday is translated into Saviynt's internal data model, </br>
and in this case, USERNAME belongs to Saviynt (EIC), while wd:User_Name belongs to Workday.</br>
</div></br>



<div>Q20.Which of the following connection types is best suited to expose Workday reports as a data service?</br>
A.Workday-RAAS</br>
B.Workday-REST</br>
C.Workday-OAuth</br>
D.Workday-SOAP</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_020"/>
<div class="hidden_show_020">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The connection type best suited to expose Workday reports as a data service in Saviynt is A. Workday-RAAS (Report as a Service). Here's why:</br>
</br>
Workday-RAAS: This connection type is specifically designed to integrate with Workday's RaaS functionality. Workday RaaS allows you to expose custom reports created within Workday as web services that can be consumed by external applications like Saviynt.</br>
</br>
Data Service for Reports: RaaS essentially turns a Workday report into a data service, making it easy to retrieve the report's data in a structured format (typically XML or JSON).</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Integration: Saviynt's Workday-RAAS connection type is built to leverage this capability, allowing you to:</br>
</br>
Select Workday Reports: Choose the specific Workday reports you want to integrate with.</br>
</br>
Import Data: Import the data from those reports into Saviynt for various purposes (e.g., identity governance, access certification, analytics).</br>
</br>
Schedule Imports: Schedule regular data imports to keep Saviynt's data synchronized with Workday.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
B . Workday-REST: While Workday has a REST API, it's more general-purpose and not specifically tailored for exposing reports as data services in the same way as RaaS.</br>
</br>
C . Workday-OAuth: OAuth is an authorization protocol, not a connection type for retrieving report data.</br>
</br>
D . Workday-SOAP: Workday's SOAP API is being gradually replaced by the REST API and is less focused on report data retrieval than RaaS.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q21.Access privileges for any specific Analytical Control can be assigned using SAV Roles. Which of the following tasks can be performed, by default, by users belonging to an SAV Role?</br>
A.Only view the configurations of the Control</br>
B.View Control, Run Control, and View Analytic History of the Control</br>
C.Only view the Analytic History of the Control</br>
D.View Control and Run Control</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_021"/>
<div class="hidden_show_021">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
When access privileges for a specific Analytical Control are assigned using SAV Roles in Saviynt, users belonging to that role can, by default, perform the following tasks: B. View Control, Run Control, and View Analytic History of the Control. Here's a breakdown:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Saviynt uses RBAC to manage access to various features and functionalities, including Analytical Controls.</br>
</br>
Analytical Controls: These are pre-defined or custom-built analytics reports or dashboards.</br>
</br>
Default Permissions: When a user is granted access to an Analytical Control via an SAV Role, they typically receive a set of default permissions:</br>
</br>
View Control: Allows the user to view the configuration and definition of the Analytical Control (e.g., the query, parameters, visualization).</br>
</br>
Run Control: Allows the user to execute the Analytical Control and generate results.</br>
</br>
View Analytic History: Allows the user to see the history of previous executions of the Analytical Control, including the results and timestamps.</br>
</br>
Why These Permissions Are Important:</br>
</br>
Transparency: Users can understand how the analytics are defined and generated.</br>
</br>
Usability: Users can run the analytics and obtain insights.</br>
</br>
Auditing: Users can review past results for trend analysis or investigation.</br>
</br>
Other Options:</br>
</br>
A . Only view the configurations of the Control: This is too restrictive; users need to be able to run the control to get value from it.</br>
</br>
C . Only view the Analytic History of the Control: This is also too limited; users should be able to run the control and view its configuration as well.</br>
</br>
D . View Control and Run Control: While closer, it's missing the 'View Analytic History' permission, which is important for auditing and analysis.</br>
</br>

<div>Q22.Which of the following formats is suitable for downloading an Analytics report? (Select all that apply)</br>
A.CSV file and Excel Sheet</br>
B.Text file</br>
C.CSV file only</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_022"/>
<div class="hidden_show_022">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The formats suitable for downloading an Analytics report in Saviynt typically include A. CSV file and Excel Sheet. Here's an explanation:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Reporting Capabilities: Saviynt provides options for exporting and downloading analytics reports in various formats to facilitate data sharing and further analysis.</br>
</br>
Common Export Formats:</br>
</br>
CSV (Comma Separated Values): A widely used format for storing tabular data in plain text. It's easily imported into various data analysis tools and spreadsheet programs.</br>
</br>
Excel Sheet (e.g., .xlsx): A popular spreadsheet format that allows for data organization, formatting, and calculations.</br>
</br>
Why These Formats Are Suitable:</br>
</br>
Data Analysis: Both CSV and Excel formats are well-suited for further data analysis and manipulation.</br>
</br>
Reporting: They are commonly used for creating reports and sharing data with stakeholders.</br>
</br>
Compatibility: Most data analysis and reporting tools support these formats.</br>
</br>
Other Less Common Options: While less frequent, Saviynt might offer other export formats like PDF, depending on the specific version and configuration.</br>
</br>
B . Text file: Although technically a text file, a raw .txt export might not be as useful for structured data like analytics reports. CSV would be preferred.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: CSV and Excel are the most common and practical formats for downloading analytics reports from Saviynt, offering flexibility for data analysis, reporting, and sharing.</br>

<div>Q23.How can a single report be configured to display the account attributes of all the accounts to Application Owners?</br>
A.Use Elasticsearch Query</br>
B.V2 Analytics using SQL Query with External Connection</br>
C.V2 Analytics using SQL Query with Allowed Action</br>
D.V2 Analytics using SQL Query with User Context</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_023"/>
<div class="hidden_show_023">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
To configure a single report that displays the account attributes of all the accounts to their respective Application Owners in Saviynt, the best approach is D. V2 Analytics using SQL Query with User Context. Here's a breakdown:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Analytics V2: This is Saviynt's newer analytics platform, offering more advanced features and flexibility compared to the older version.</br>
</br>
SQL Query with User Context: This is the key to achieving the desired outcome. 'User Context' means that the query will be executed in the context of the currently logged-in user (in this case, the Application Owner).</br>
</br>
How it Works:</br>
</br>
Dynamic Filtering: When an Application Owner runs the report, the 'User Context' will automatically filter the data to show only the accounts that they own.</br>
</br>
Security and Data Privacy: This ensures that each Application Owner only sees the data that they are authorized to access.</br>
</br>
SQL Query Structure: The SQL query would likely involve a JOIN between the accounts table and a table that defines application ownership (e.g., applications), using a WHERE clause that filters based on the current user's ID or username. Something like this (syntax might need adjustment for Saviynt's specific SQL dialect):</br>
</br>
SELECT a.*</br>
</br>
FROM accounts a</br>
</br>
JOIN applications app ON a.application_id = app.application_id</br>
</br>
WHERE app.owner_id = ${CURRENT_USER_ID} -- This is the user context part</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
A . Use Elasticsearch Query: While Elasticsearch can be used for analytics, it might not be the best tool for this specific requirement, as it doesn't inherently support the concept of 'User Context' in the same way as SQL queries in Analytics V2.</br>
</br>
B . V2 Analytics using SQL Query with External Connection: External connections are used to query data from external databases, which is not necessary in this scenario.</br>
</br>
C . V2 Analytics using SQL Query with Allowed Action: Allowed Actions are used to define actions that can be performed on analytics results, not for filtering data based on user context.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q24.Multiple indices can be selected while creating Analytics using the Elasticsearch Query.</br>
A.True</br>
B.False</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_024"/>
<div class="hidden_show_024">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
It is True that multiple indices can be selected while creating Analytics using the Elasticsearch Query in Saviynt. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Analytics and Elasticsearch: Saviynt's analytics capabilities are often built on top of Elasticsearch, a powerful search and analytics engine.</br>
</br>
Indices in Elasticsearch: In Elasticsearch, an index is like a database table. It's a collection of documents with similar characteristics. Saviynt uses indices to store various types of data, such as user data, account data, entitlement data, and event logs.</br>
</br>
Multi-Index Queries: Elasticsearch allows you to query across multiple indices simultaneously. This is a fundamental feature of the search engine.</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Interface: When creating analytics in Saviynt using Elasticsearch queries, the interface typically allows you to select multiple indices as the data source for your analysis.</br>
</br>
Use Cases: This capability is essential for creating comprehensive analytics that span different data domains. For example, you might want to analyze user access patterns (from one index) in conjunction with application usage data (from another index).</br>
</br>
In conclusion: The ability to select multiple indices is a core feature of Elasticsearch and is supported within Saviynt's analytics interface,</br>

<div>Q25.What triggers a Request Rule?</br>
A.When a user is imported</br>
B.When Access Request is created and matches the conditions</br>
C.When the Run Detective Rule job is run</br>
D.When changes are detected in the import</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_025"/>
<div class="hidden_show_025">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
A Request Rule in Saviynt is triggered B. When an Access Request is created and matches the conditions. Here's a detailed explanation:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Request Rules: Request Rules are a type of rule specifically designed to govern the access request process.</br>
</br>
Triggering Event: The primary trigger for a Request Rule is the creation of a new access request within Saviynt's Access Request System (ARS).</br>
</br>
Condition Evaluation: When a new request is submitted, Saviynt evaluates the conditions defined in any applicable Request Rules. These conditions can be based on:</br>
</br>
Requester Attributes: (e.g., department, location, job title)</br>
</br>
Beneficiary Attributes: (if the request is for another user)</br>
</br>
Requested Resource: (e.g., application, role, entitlement)</br>
</br>
Request Details: (e.g., requested start/end dates)</br>
</br>
Rule Actions: If the conditions of a Request Rule are met, the rule's defined actions are executed. These actions can include:</br>
</br>
Modifying the request: (e.g., adding approvers, changing the approval workflow)</br>
</br>
Auto-approving or auto-rejecting the request:</br>
</br>
Generating notifications:</br>
</br>
Triggering other workflows:</br>
</br>
Other Options:</br>
</br>
A . When a user is imported: This might trigger User Update Rules or birthright rules, but not Request Rules.</br>
</br>
C . When the Run Detective Rule job is run: This job evaluates detective rules, not Request Rules.</br>
</br>
D . When changes are detected in the import: This could trigger various rules, but not specifically Request Rules.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q26.As part of a recent organizational change, John, a Security Consultant, was moved from Department A to B. To follow the Least Privilege Principle, there is a requirement to certify all existing entitlements of John by relevant stakeholders. Now, you have configured a User Update Rule to launch a certification when the department changes. Which of the following actions will you configure to support this scenario?</br>
A.Launch Manager Campaign</br>
B.Launch Service Account Campaign</br>
C.Launch Entitlement Owner Campaign</br>
D.Launch Organization Owner Campaign</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_026"/>
<div class="hidden_show_026">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To certify all existing entitlements of John by relevant stakeholders after he moves from Department A to B, and you have a User Update Rule to trigger a certification, the action you should configure is C. Launch Entitlement Owner Campaign. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Certification Campaigns: Saviynt supports various types of certification campaigns to review and validate user access.</br>
</br>
Entitlement Owner Campaign: This specific campaign type is designed to have the owners of entitlements (typically application or business owners) review and certify the users who have access to those entitlements.</br>
</br>
User Update Rule Trigger: The User Update Rule, triggered by the department change, can initiate the certification process.</br>
</br>
Least Privilege Principle: This approach aligns with the principle of least privilege by ensuring that access is regularly reviewed and validated, especially after significant changes like a department transfer.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
</br>
A . Launch Manager Campaign: While manager campaigns are useful, they might not be the most appropriate in this case. Entitlement owners are generally more knowledgeable about who should have access to specific entitlements.</br>
</br>
B . Launch Service Account Campaign: This is for certifying service accounts, not user entitlements.</br>
</br>
D . Launch Organization Owner Campaign: This is not a standard campaign type in Saviynt and might not be relevant to certifying user entitlements.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: Launching an Entitlement Owner Campaign from a User Update Rule triggered by a department change is the most effective way to ensure that John's existing entitlements are reviewed and certified by the appropriate stakeholders, adhering to the principle of least privilege.</br>

<div>Q27.Which of the following should be enabled in the User Update Rule when the Rule has to be applied for an existing user?</br>
A.Trigger when user is created from import</br>
B.Retrofit rule actions for users</br>
C.Trigger when user is updated from import</br>
D.Action > Rerun All Provisioning Rules</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_027"/>
<div class="hidden_show_027">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
To apply a User Update Rule to existing users in Saviynt, you should enable the option B. Retrofit rule actions for users. Here's an explanation:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's User Update Rules - Initial Application: When a User Update Rule is created, it typically applies to users who are newly created or updated after the rule is put in place.</br>
</br>
Retrofit Functionality: The 'Retrofit rule actions for users' option allows you to apply the rule retroactively to users who already exist in the system and meet the rule's conditions.</br>
</br>
How it Works: When enabled, Saviynt will evaluate the rule against all existing users. If a user matches the rule's conditions, the defined actions (e.g., assigning roles, updating attributes) will be applied to that user, even if they were created before the rule.</br>
</br>
Use Cases: This is useful when you create a new rule that should have been in place all along, or when you need to make a broad change to existing user configurations based on a new policy.</br>
</br>
Other Options:</br>
</br>
A . Trigger when user is created from import: This applies the rule to new users imported into Saviynt, not existing users.</br>
</br>
C . Trigger when user is updated from import: This applies the rule when existing users are updated via import, but it won't necessarily apply to all existing users who meet the conditions.</br>
</br>
D . Action > Rerun All Provisioning Rules: This action is more general and might not be the most efficient way to apply a specific User Update Rule retroactively.</br>
</br>
In summary: The 'Retrofit rule actions for users' setting within a Saviynt User Update Rule is crucial for applying the rule's logic and actions to existing users, ensuring consistent configuration across the user base.</br>

<div>Q28.What does the following image signify?</br>
Assigning of Enterprise Role based on a dynamic variable city.</br>
A.ssigning of Enterprise Role based on users' department</br>
B.Assigning of Enterprise Role based on users' location</br>
C.Assigning of Enterprise Role based on concatenation of dynamic variable city and Finance</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_028"/>
<div class="hidden_show_028">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The image signifies B. Assigning of Enterprise Role based on users' location. Here's a breakdown, assuming the image depicts a portion of a Saviynt User Update Rule configuration:</br>
</br>
Dynamic Variable 'City': The image highlights the use of a dynamic variable called 'city.' This strongly suggests that the rule is using the user's location (city) as a key factor in determining role assignment.</br>
</br>
Saviynt's User Update Rules and Dynamic Variables: User Update Rules in Saviynt allow for the use of dynamic variables, which represent user attributes. These variables can be used in conditions and actions within the rule.</br>
</br>
Enterprise Role Assignment: The context of the question implies that the rule is assigning an Enterprise Role based on the value of this 'city' variable.</br>
</br>
Example: The rule might be configured to assign an Enterprise Role like 'Sydney-Users' to users whose 'city' attribute is 'Sydney.'</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Likely:</br>
</br>
A . Assigning of Enterprise Role based on users' department: There's no mention of 'department' in the provided information.</br>
</br>
C . Assigning of Enterprise Role based on concatenation of dynamic variable city and Finance: While concatenation is possible in Saviynt, there's no indication that 'Finance' is involved here. The focus seems to be solely on the 'city' variable.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: Based on the information given, the image most likely represents a Saviynt User Update Rule that assigns an Enterprise Role based on the user's location, as indicated by the dynamic variable 'city.</br>
</div></br>


<div>Q29.John, who recently joined an organization as a full-time employee, is required to work from the Sydney office. He was assigned birthright entitlements as part of the new joiner provisioning. Which of the following Enterprise Roles will be assigned to John from the Birthright Rule?</br>
A. Birthright - Sydney</br>
B. Birthright - Permanent - Full-time</br>
C. Birthright - All</br>
D. Birthright - Employee</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_029"/>
<div class="hidden_show_029">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
In this scenario, where John is a new full-time employee required to work from the Sydney office, the most specific and appropriate Enterprise Role assigned from the Birthright Rule would likely be A. Birthright - Sydney. Here's the reasoning:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Birthright Roles and Rules: Birthright roles are designed to automatically provision access based on specific criteria like location, job role, or employment type. Birthright rules define the conditions for assigning these roles.</br>
</br>
Specificity of Role Assignment: The goal is to assign the most relevant and granular role based on the available information. In this case, John's location (Sydney) is the most specific criterion mentioned.</br>
</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Likely:</br>
</br>
B . Birthright - Permanent - Full-time: While John is a full-time employee, this role might be too broad if there are other location-specific roles.</br>
</br>
C . Birthright - All: This role is likely too generic and would grant excessive access. It's generally not good practice to have an 'all-encompassing' birthright role.</br>
</br>
D . Birthright - Employee: Similar to the 'Full-time' role, this might be too broad if location-specific roles are available.</br>
</br>
Best Practices: It's a best practice in identity governance to use the most specific criteria possible when assigning birthright access. This helps enforce the principle of least privilege.</br>
</br>
In summary: The 'Birthright - Sydney' role is the most appropriate choice because it aligns with John's specific work location, ensuring he receives the necessary access for his role while adhering to the principle of least privilege.</br>

<div>Q30.Which of the following Jobs should be created and scheduled to evaluate Rules on a need basis?</br>
A.Run Detective Rules and Take Action</br>
B.Provisioning Job</br>
C.User Import via Connection</br>
D.Trigger Chain Job</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_030"/>
<div class="hidden_show_030">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The Job that should be created and scheduled to evaluate Rules on a need basis in Saviynt is A . Run Detective Rules and Take Action. Here's an explanation:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Jobs: Saviynt uses Jobs to perform various tasks, including data imports, rule evaluations, and provisioning operations.</br>
</br>
'Run Detective Rules and Take Action': This specific job is designed to:</br>
</br>
Evaluate Rules: It evaluates rules that are configured for detective (monitoring) purposes. These rules typically check for specific conditions or changes in user attributes, access rights, or other data.</br>
</br>
Take Action (Optional): Based on the rule evaluation results, the job can be configured to automatically take actions, such as:</br>
</br>
Generating alerts or notifications.</br>
</br>
Creating tasks for administrators to review.</br>
</br>
Triggering workflows.</br>
</br>
Automatically remediating issues (e.g., revoking access if a rule detects a violation).</br>
</br>
Scheduling: This job can be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., daily, hourly) to continuously monitor for changes and enforce defined rules.</br>
</br>
On-Demand Execution: You can also run this job on-demand to evaluate rules immediately.</br>
</br>
Other Options:</br>
</br>
B . Provisioning Job: This job is primarily used for provisioning access to target systems, not for evaluating general-purpose rules.</br>
</br>
C . User Import via Connection: This job is for importing user data from external sources.</br>
</br>
D . Trigger Chain Job: This allows for running a series or 'chain' of jobs, but it doesn't directly evaluate rules itself.</br>
</div></br>


<div>Q31.Which of the following objects is available in the User Update Rule to configure Rule conditions?</br>
A.Users</br>
B.Accounts</br>
C.Roles</br>
D.Entitlements</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_031"/>
<div class="hidden_show_031">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The object that is available in the User Update Rule to configure Rule conditions in Saviynt is A . Users. Here's an explanation:</br>
</br>
User Update Rule Purpose: As mentioned before, User Update Rules are used to automatically update user attributes based on certain conditions.</br>
</br>
Condition Based on User Attributes: The conditions for triggering a User Update Rule are primarily based on attributes of the User object itself.</br>
</br>
Examples of User Attributes: These attributes can include:</br>
</br>
User Status: (e.g., Active, Inactive, Disabled)</br>
</br>
Department:</br>
</br>
Location:</br>
</br>
Job Title:</br>
</br>
Manager:</br>
</br>
Custom Attributes: Any custom attributes defined for users in your Saviynt environment.</br>
</br>
Triggering the Rule: When a user's attributes change, and those changes match the conditions defined in a User Update Rule, the rule is triggered.</br>
</br>
Other Options:</br>
</br>
B . Accounts: While account attributes can be updated as an action of a User Update Rule, the conditions for triggering the rule are typically based on user attributes, not account attributes.</br>
</br>
C . Roles: Similar to accounts, roles can be assigned or removed as an action of a User Update Rule, but the triggering conditions are usually based on user attributes.</br>
</br>
D . Entitlements: Entitlements are also typically managed as an action of a User Update Rule, not as part of the triggering condition.</br>
</br>
In conclusion: The User object and its attributes are the primary focus for defining conditions within a Saviynt User Update Rule. Changes to user attributes trigger the rule, which can then perform actions such as updating other user attributes, accounts, roles, or entitlements.</br>
</div></br>


<div>Q32.Which of the following Rules should always be used in conjunction with the Organization object?</br>
A.Technical Rule</br>
B.User Update Rule</br>
C.Scan Rule</br>
D.Request Rule</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_032"/>
<div class="hidden_show_032">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The type of Rule that should always be used in conjunction with the Organization object in Saviynt is the B. User Update Rule. Here's the explanation:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Organization Object: The Organization object in Saviynt represents the organizational structure or hierarchy (e.g., departments, locations, cost centers). It's often used to define relationships between users and organizational units.</br>
</br>
User Update Rule: This type of rule is designed to automatically update user attributes based on changes in other user attributes or related objects.</br>
</br>
Using Organization with User Update Rule: The User Update Rule is frequently used with the Organization object to automate user management based on organizational changes.</br>
</br>
Example: You can create a User Update Rule that automatically assigns users to specific roles or groups based on their department (defined in the Organization object). If a user is moved to a different department, the rule will trigger and update their roles or group memberships accordingly.</br>
</br>
Dynamic User Management: This combination enables dynamic user management, ensuring that user attributes and access rights are automatically adjusted as users move within the organization.</br>
</br>
Other Options:</br>
</br>
A . Technical Rule: Technical Rules are more general-purpose and can be used for various tasks, but they are not specifically tied to the Organization object.</br>
</br>
C . Scan Rule: Scan Rules are used for data analysis and identifying potential issues, not for updating user attributes based on organizational structure.</br>
</br>
D . Request Rule: Request Rules are related to access request workflows, not to automatic user updates.</br>
</br>
In essence: The User Update Rule, when used in conjunction with the Organization object, provides a powerful way to automate user management in Saviynt, ensuring that user attributes and access rights are dynamically updated based on changes in the organizational structure.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q33 Where can an Admin get the details of a successfully executed Rule?　</br>
A. Archived Rule Trail</br>
B. Archived Application Logs</br>
C. Current Rule Trail</br>
D. Action Trail</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_033"/>
<div class="hidden_show_033">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To get the details of a successfully executed Rule in Saviynt, an Admin should look in the C. Current Rule Trail. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Rule Engine and Logging: Saviynt's rule engine executes various types of rules (e.g., birthright rules, user update rules, technical rules). </br>
It maintains logs to track rule execution and outcomes.</br>
Current Rule Trail: This log specifically captures the details of recently executed rules, including:</br>
Rule Name: The name of the rule that was executed.</br>
Execution Time: The timestamp of when the rule was executed.</br>
Status: Whether the rule execution was successful or not.</br>
Details: Specific information about the rule's execution, such as the conditions that were evaluated and the actions that were taken.</br>
Troubleshooting and Auditing: The Current Rule Trail is invaluable for troubleshooting rule behavior and for auditing purposes, providing a clear record of what rules were executed and their results.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A . Archived Rule Trail: This log stores details of older rule executions that have been archived. </br>
It's useful for historical analysis but not for recent executions.</br>
B . Archived Application Logs: These logs are related to application activity, not rule execution.</br>
D . Action Trail: The Action Trail captures general user and administrative actions within Saviynt, </br>
but it might not provide the detailed information about rule execution that the Current Rule Trail does.</br>
</div></br>


<div>Q34 Adam, an Admin, created a rule to provide birthright access; however, the access should be deprovisioned when the condition fails. </br>
Which of the following options should be applied for this scenario?　</br>
A. Remove the Access Rule</br>
B. Apply a new Technical Rule to remove the Access</br>
C. Remove the birthright Access if the condition fails under the created Rule</br>
D. Use the Request Rule</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_034"/>
<div class="hidden_show_034">
</br>
Answer: C
Explanation:
To automatically deprovision birthright access when the defining condition fails, </br>
the correct option is C. Remove the birthright Access if the condition fails under the created Rule. Here's a detailed explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Birthright Access (Automatic Provisioning): Saviynt allows administrators to define rules </br>
that automatically grant access (birthright access) based on user attributes or </br>
other criteria (e.g., new hires in a specific department automatically get access to certain applications).</br>
Rule-Based Access Management: These rules are a core part of Saviynt's access management capabilities, allowing for dynamic and automated provisioning.
'Remove the birthright Access if the condition fails': This option, typically found within the birthright rule configuration itself, is crucial for ensuring that access is revoked when the conditions that granted it are no longer met.</br>
Example: If a user is granted access to an application because they are in the 'Sales' department, and they are later moved to the 'Marketing' department, the condition for the birthright rule would fail, and Saviynt would automatically deprovision the access.</br>
Saviynt's Continuous Monitoring: Saviynt continuously monitors user attributes and rule conditions. When a change occurs that causes a condition to fail, the deprovisioning action is triggered.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A . Remove the Access Rule: This would remove the entire rule, preventing it from granting access to anyone, not just the user whose condition has failed.</br>
B . Apply a new Technical Rule to remove the Access: While technically possible, it's less efficient and more complex than using the built-in option within the </bbirthright rule.</br>
D . Use the Request Rule: Request Rules are for access requests, not for automatically provisioning or deprovisioning birthright access.

<div>Q35 What is the purpose of a Custom Assignment Workflow block?　</br>
A. Request must be approved based on any attribute of a user or account, or a custom condition</br>
B. Request must be approved by the Role Owner</br>
C. Request must be approved by the Application Owner</br>
D. None of the above</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_035"/>
<div class="hidden_show_035">
</br>
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The purpose of a Custom Assignment Workflow block in Saviynt is A. Request must be approved based on any attribute of a user or account, or a custom condition. Here's a detailed explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Workflow Flexibility: Saviynt's workflow engine is designed to be highly flexible, allowing organizations to create complex approval processes tailored to their specific needs.</br>
Standard Approver Types: While Saviynt provides standard approver types like Manager, Role Owner, and Application Owner, there are often scenarios where the approval needs to be routed based on more dynamic or complex criteria.</br>
Custom Assignment Block: This is where the 'Custom Assignment' block comes in. It allows you to define custom logic to determine the approver(s) for a request.</br>
Attribute-Based Approvals: You can use attributes of the requester, the beneficiary (if different), or even attributes of the requested resource (e.g., application, entitlement) to determine the approver. For example:</br>
Requests from users in a specific department could be routed to a particular security officer.</br>
Requests for access to a high-risk application could be routed to a specific risk management team.</br>
Custom Conditions: You can also define custom conditions using scripting or other logic within the Custom Assignment block. This allows for even greater flexibility in defining the approval routing.</br>
Example: You might have a condition that checks if the requested entitlement has a certain risk level and, if so, routes the approval to a specific compliance officer.</br>
Other Options:</br>
B . Request must be approved by the Role Owner: This is handled by a standard 'TASK Access Approve' activity assigned to the Role Owner.</br>
C . Request must be approved by the Application Owner: Similar to the above, this is a standard approver type.</br>
D . None of the above: Option A accurately describes the purpose of the Custom Assignment block.</br>

<div>Q36 The Sales department of a company requires an approval workflow to be created for an application where the Manager's approval should be followed by the Application Owner's approval. Which of the following sequences form the correct order of the workflow events?　</br>
A. Start > Resource Owner's Approval > Manager's Approval > Approve/Reject > End</br>
B. Start > Manager's Approval > Custom Assignment > Approve/Reject > End</br>
C. Start > Manager's Approval > Access Approval > Approve/Reject > End</br>
D. Start > Manager's Approval > Resource Owner's Approval > Approve/Reject > End</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_036"/>
<div class="hidden_show_036">
</br>
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
The correct sequence of workflow events for an application </br>
where the Manager's approval should be followed by </br>
the Application Owner's approval is D. Start > Manager's Approval > Resource Owner's Approval > Approve/Reject > End. Here's a breakdown:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Workflow Structure: Saviynt workflows follow a sequential structure, starting with a 'Start' event and ending with an 'End' event.</br>
Workflow Activities: Each step in the workflow is represented by an activity, such as an approval task.</br>
Manager's Approval: In this scenario, the first required approval is from the Manager. This would be represented </br>
by a 'TASK Access Approve' activity (or similar, depending on the specific configuration) assigned to the user's manager.</br>
Application Owner's Approval: After the Manager's approval, the workflow needs to proceed to the Application Owner for their approval. </br>
This would be another 'TASK Access Approve' activity assigned to the Application Owner. </br>
In Saviynt terms, Application Owner is a type of Resource Owner.</br>
Approve/Reject: This activity represents the decision point where the final approver (in this case, </br>
the Application Owner) either approves or rejects the request.</br>
End: The workflow concludes with the 'End' event, signifying the completion of the process.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A . Start > Resource Owner's Approval > Manager's Approval > Approve/Reject > End: Incorrect order; the manager's approval should come before the application owner's.</br>
B . Start > Manager's Approval > Custom Assignment > Approve/Reject > End: 'Custom Assignment' is not the most appropriate activity for a standard approval step. 'TASK Access Approve' would be more suitable.</br>
C . Start > Manager's Approval > Access Approval > Approve/Reject > End: 'Access Approval' is a bit redundant; 'TASK Access Approve' assigned to the appropriate role is clearer.</br>
In essence: The correct workflow sequence accurately reflects the required approval hierarchy: first the Manager, then the Application Owner, followed by the final decision (Approve/Reject) and the end of the workflow.</br>
</div></br>
