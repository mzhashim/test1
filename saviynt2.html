<div>Q3.Anitha, a manager, has a large number of users reporting to her, with most of them working remotely.</br>
Which of the following Campaign Types would you recommend for this scenario to reduce certification fatigue for Anitha?</br>
A. Launch User Manager Campaign and then Self Certification Campaign on certified items</br>
B. Launch Application Owner Campaign and then Self Certification Campaign on certified items</br>
C. Launch a Self Certification Campaign and then User Manager Campaign on certified items</br>
D. Launch Service Account Campaign and then User Manager Campaign on certified items</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_003"/>
<div class="hidden_show_003">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To reduce certification fatigue for Anitha, a manager with a large number of remote users, the recommended approach is C. </br>
Launch a Self Certification Campaign and then User Manager Campaign on certified items. Here's the rationale:</br>
Self Certification Campaign:</br>
Purpose: Allows users to review and certify their own access.</br>
Benefits for this scenario:</br>
Reduces Manager Burden: Shifts the initial review responsibility from Anitha to the individual users, who are most familiar with their own access needs.</br>
Scalability: Well-suited for large, distributed teams, as it doesn't rely solely on the manager's capacity.</br>
Empowerment: Gives users more control over their access and promotes a culture of accountability.</br>
User Manager Campaign on Certified Items:</br>
Purpose: Allows managers to review and certify their subordinates' access.</br>
Benefits when combined with Self Certification:</br>
Focus on Exceptions: Anitha can focus her review on items that were not self-certified or that require further scrutiny after the initial self-certification.</br>
Reduced Volume: The volume of items Anitha needs to review is significantly reduced, as users have already certified their own access.</br>
Increased Efficiency: Streamlines the manager's review process, making it more manageable and less time-consuming.</br>

Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
A . Launch User Manager Campaign and then Self Certification Campaign on certified items: This sequence is less effective because it puts the burden on the manager first, potentially leading to fatigue.</br>
B . Launch Application Owner Campaign and then Self Certification Campaign on certified items: Application Owner campaigns are not relevant to a manager's review of their subordinates' access.</br>
D . Launch Service Account Campaign and then User Manager Campaign on certified items: Service Account campaigns are for reviewing service accounts, not user access.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q4.Jane was managing an AD Group; however, she had to decommission this group and revoke access for all the users.</br>
Which of the following options should be used to perform the above task?</br>
A.Segregation of Duties</br>
B.Entitlement Update Rule</br>
C.Mitigation Control</br>
D.Entitlement Owner Certification</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_004"/>
<div class="hidden_show_004">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
To decommission an AD Group and revoke access for all users, Jane should use D. Entitlement Owner Certification. Here is why:</br>
AD Group as an Entitlement: In Saviynt, an AD Group is typically represented as an Entitlement.</br>
Entitlement Owner Certification: This type of campaign allows the designated owner of an entitlement (in this case, Jane, as the manager of the AD Group) to review and certify who should have access to that entitlement.</br>
Revoking Access: As the Entitlement Owner, Jane can use the certification campaign to:</br>
Review the list of users: See all users who are currently members of the AD Group.</br>
Revoke access for all users: Mark all users for removal from the group.</br>
Decommissioning the Group: After revoking access for all users through the certification, Jane can then proceed with decommissioning the AD Group itself (either through Saviynt if it manages AD group lifecycle or directly in Active Directory).</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
A . Segregation of Duties: SoD is a principle, not a specific action for revoking access.</br>
B . Entitlement Update Rule: While rules can automate some actions, a certification campaign provides a more controlled and auditable way to review and revoke access, especially for a sensitive action like decommissioning a group.</br>
C . Mitigation Control: Mitigation controls are used to manage SoD conflicts, not for revoking access to entitlements.</br>
In conclusion: An Entitlement Owner Certification campaign provides a structured and auditable way for Jane to review the membership of the AD Group, revoke access for all users, and prepare for the group's decommissioning, aligning with best practices for access management.</br>

<div>Q5.Which of the following options can a Campaign Owner use to view the Entitlements Query that was used in a previously launched Campaign?</br>
A.Reconfigure option</br>
B.Campaign Export</br>
C.Campaign Summary</br>
D.Export option at the top right corner of the page, next to the Refresh Progress option</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_005"/>
<div class="hidden_show_005">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To view the Entitlements Query used in a previously launched Campaign in Saviynt, a Campaign Owner can use the C. Campaign Summary. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Campaign Summary: The Campaign Summary provides a detailed overview of a campaign's configuration, including:</br>
Campaign Scope: The users, applications, or entitlements included in the campaign.</br>
Filters and Queries: Any filters or queries used to define the campaign scope, including the Entitlements Query.</br>
Certifier Information: Details about the assigned certifiers.</br>
Schedule: The campaign's start and end dates.</br>
Status: The current status of the campaign (e.g., Active, Completed, Expired).</br>
Accessing the Entitlements Query: The Campaign Summary typically includes a section that displays the exact query used to select the entitlements included in the campaign.</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
A . Reconfigure option: While you might be able to see the query by going into the reconfiguration, it's not the most direct way. The Campaign Summary is designed to provide this information readily.</br>
B . Campaign Export: Exporting the campaign data might include the list of entitlements but not necessarily the original query used to select them.</br>
D . Export option at the top right corner of the page, next to the Refresh Progress option: This option typically exports the current view of the campaign data, not the underlying configuration details like the Entitlements Query.</br>
In conclusion: The Campaign Summary in Saviynt is the most direct and convenient place for a Campaign Owner to review the detailed configuration of a campaign, including the Entitlements Query used to define the campaign's scope.</br>

<div>Q6.The process of Attestation(認証) or Certification can be best described as:</br>
A.Segregation of Duties</br>
B.Access Reviews</br>
C.Access Request</br>
D.Application Onboarding</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_006"/>
<div class="hidden_show_006">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The process of Attestation or Certification in the context of Saviynt can be best described as B . Access Reviews. Here's why:</br>
Attestation/Certification: These terms are often </br>
used interchangeably(交換可能に) in the context of identity governance. </br>
They refer to the process of formally reviewing and approving or revoking user access rights.</br>
Access Reviews: This is the broader term that encompasses the entire process of periodically reviewing user access to ensure it is appropriate and aligned with business needs and security policies. Attestation and Certification are specific actions performed within an access review.</br>
Saviynt's Campaigns: Saviynt's campaigns are designed to facilitate and manage access reviews.</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
A . Segregation of Duties: SoD is a principle that aims to prevent fraud and errors by dividing critical tasks among different individuals. While access reviews can help enforce SoD, they are not the same thing.</br>
C . Access Request: This is the process of requesting access to resources, which is a separate process from reviewing existing access.</br>
D . Application Onboarding: This is the process of integrating an application into Saviynt, which is a prerequisite for access reviews but not the review process itself.</br>
In conclusion: Attestation or Certification, as performed within Saviynt campaigns, are integral parts of the broader process of Access Reviews, which aim to ensure that user access is appropriate, authorized, and aligned with security policies.</br>

<div>Q7.An Application Owner Campaign can have multiple primary Certifiers and a single secondary Certifier.</br>
A.True</br>
B.False</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_007"/>
<div class="hidden_show_007">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The statement 'An Application Owner Campaign can have multiple primary Certifiers(証明する) and a single secondary Certifier' is generally False in Saviynt. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Application Owner Campaign: This campaign type is designed for Application Owners to review and certify access to their applications.</br>
Primary Certifier: There is usually a single designated Application Owner for each application. This is because application ownership is typically a single point of accountability. While it is technically possible to assign multiple owners, it is not considered a best practice.</br>
Secondary Certifiers (Backup/Delegates): Application Owner Campaigns can have multiple secondary certifiers. These are often used as:</br>
Backup: To ensure the campaign can proceed if the primary certifier is unavailable.</br>
Delegates: To allow the primary certifier to delegate some of the certification tasks.</br>
Consultants: Other stakeholders, such as security or compliance teams, who can be consulted during the decision-making process.</br>
Why the Statement Is Generally False: The core principle of application ownership implies a single point of accountability. While multiple secondary certifiers can assist, having multiple primary certifiers can lead to confusion and conflicting decisions.</br>
Possible Exceptions (Less Common):</br>
Highly Customized Configurations: In some very specific scenarios, organizations might customize Saviynt to allow multiple primary certifiers for an application, but this is not a standard or recommended practice.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q8.Given that an Admin launched a Role Ownership Campaign for you, which of the following options can you not certify?</br>
A.Role Ownership</br>
B.User membership of the Role</br>
C.Delete Role</br>
D.Associated Entitlements</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_008"/>
<div class="hidden_show_008">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
Given that an Admin launched a Role Ownership Campaign for you in Saviynt, the option you can not certify is A. Role Ownership. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Role Ownership Campaign: This type of campaign is specifically designed for reviewing and certifying the ownership of roles, not the other aspects of a role.</br>
Your Role as Certifier: In this scenario, you are the designated reviewer for role ownership. This means you are responsible for confirming who should be the owner of specific roles.</br>
What You Can Certify in a Role Ownership Campaign:</br>
Confirm or Change Role Owner: You can confirm that the current role owner is correct or assign a new owner.</br>
What You Cannot Certify in This Campaign:</br>
A . Role Ownership: You are the one certifying role ownership, so you cannot certify your own action of assigning an owner. It would be a circular process.</br>
B . User membership of the Role: This is typically reviewed in a User Access Campaign or a Role Membership Campaign.</br>
C . Delete Role: Role deletion is an administrative action, not typically part of a Role Ownership Campaign.</br>
D . Associated Entitlements: Entitlement certification is usually handled in an Entitlement Owner Campaign or as part of a broader User Access Campaign.</br>
In essence: A Role Ownership Campaign focuses solely on validating and assigning role owners. Other aspects of role management, such as user membership or associated entitlements, are handled in different campaign types or through separate administrative actions. As the certifier in this specific campaign, you cannot certify the very action you are performing, which is assigning role ownership.

<div>Q9.What is a Campaign?</br>
A.Group of similar Endpoints</br>
B.Group of User Groups</br>
C.Group of Dashboards</br>
D.Group of similar Certifications</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_009"/>
<div class="hidden_show_009">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
In Saviynt, a Campaign is best described as a D. Group of similar Certifications. Here's a breakdown:</br>
Saviynt's Campaigns and Certifications:</br>
Campaign: A container that defines the scope, schedule, participants, and other settings for a set of related access certifications.</br>
Certification: The individual review task assigned to a Certifier (e.g., a manager reviewing their subordinates' access, an application owner reviewing users of their application).</br>
Analogy: Think of a Campaign as a project, and Certifications as individual tasks within that project.</br>
Purpose of Campaigns: Campaigns provide a structured way to manage and track access reviews, ensuring that they are conducted regularly and consistently.</br>
Examples of Campaigns:</br>
User Manager Campaign: Groups certifications where managers review their subordinates' access.</br>
Entitlement Owner Campaign: Groups certifications where entitlement owners review who has access to their entitlements.</br>
Application Owner Campaign: Groups certifications where application owners review who has access to their applications.</br>
Why Other Options Are Incorrect:</br>
A. Group of similar Endpoints: Endpoints are systems or applications connected to Saviynt, not the primary grouping within a campaign.</br>
B. Group of User Groups: User groups are collections of users, not the defining element of a campaign.</br>
C. Group of Dashboards: Dashboards provide visualizations of data, but they are not the core component of a campaign.</br>
In conclusion: A Campaign in Saviynt is essentially a container for a set of related access certifications, providing a framework for managing and organizing the review process based on specific criteria and objectives.</br>

<div>Q10.Which of the following Account statuses is not considered in a User Manager Campaign certification?</br>
A.Manually Suspended</br>
B.Inactive</br>
C.Suspended from Import Service</br>
D.Manually Provisioned</br>
</div>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_010"/>
<div class="hidden_show_010">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
The Account status that is not typically considered in a User Manager Campaign certification in Saviynt is D. </br>
Manually Provisioned. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's User Manager Campaign Focus: User Manager Campaigns primarily focus on reviewing </br>
and certifying access that is actively managed and tracked within Saviynt.</br>
Account Statuses and Their Relevance:</br>
A. Manually Suspended: Indicates an account that has been intentionally disabled within Saviynt.</br>
These accounts are often included in reviews to ensure the suspension is still valid.</br>
B. Inactive: Indicates an account that has not been used for a certain period.</br>
These accounts are often included in reviews to determine if they should be disabled or removed.</br>
C. Suspended from Import Service: Indicates an account that has been suspended due to </br>
issues during an import process. These accounts are typically reviewed to </br>
resolve the import problem and determine the appropriate account status.</br>
Manually Provisioned Accounts: These accounts are created directly in the target system, </br>
bypassing Saviynt's provisioning processes. As such, they might not be fully tracked or managed within Saviynt.</br>
Out-of-Band Access: Manually provisioned accounts represent a form of out-of-band access, </br>
which is often excluded from standard User Manager Campaigns.</br>
Separate Review Process: Organizations might have separate processes for </br>
reviewing manually provisioned accounts, such as using the RevokeOutOfBandAccessJob or a different type of campaign.</br>
In conclusion: While other account statuses like Manually Suspended, Inactive, </br>
and Suspended from Import Service are relevant to access management within Saviynt </br>
and are often included in User Manager Campaigns, Manually Provisioned accounts </br>
might be excluded because they represent access granted outside of Saviynt's control </br>
and might require a different review process.

<div>Q11.There is a requirement to have multiple users as Campaign Owners for a User Manager Campaign.</br>
Which of the following configurations would be appropriate to achieve this?</br>
A.Create a user Query and add users</br>
B.Create a user group and choose the user group as the Campaign Owner</br>
C.Create a Roles Query and add Roles of various users</br>
D.Create an Organization Query and add users</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_011"/>
<div class="hidden_show_011">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
To have multiple users as Campaign Owners for a User Manager Campaign in Saviynt, </br>
the appropriate configuration is to B. Create a user group and choose </br>
the user group as the Campaign Owner. Here's the explanation:</br>
Saviynt's User Groups: User groups are collections of users that can be used for </br>
various purposes, including assigning roles, permissions, and ownership.</br>
Campaign Owner as a User Group: Saviynt allows you to specify a user group </br>
as the owner of a campaign. This means that all members of the group will have the same campaign ownership permissions.</br>
Benefits of Using a User Group:</br>
Simplified Management: It's easier to manage a group of users than to assign individual users as campaign owners.</br>
Flexibility: You can easily add or remove users from the group to adjust campaign ownership as needed.</br>
Shared Responsibility: All members of the group share responsibility for managing the campaign.</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
A. Create a user Query and add users: While you can use queries to select users, </br>
directly using a user group is a more standard and manageable approach for assigning multiple campaign owners.</br>
C. Create a Roles Query and add Roles of various users: Roles are typically used for </br>
granting access rights, not for defining campaign ownership.</br>
D. Create an Organization Query and add users: Organization queries are related </br>
to the organizational structure and are not the best way to define a group of campaign owners.</br>
In conclusion: Using a user group as the Campaign Owner </br>
in Saviynt provides a flexible and manageable way to assign multiple users as owners, </br>
simplifying administration and promoting shared responsibility for campaign management.</br>

<div>Q12.A Campaign Owner can create various types of a User Manager Campaign to save </br>
different settings for various categories of Manager Access Reviews.</br>
A.Global Configurations</br>
B.Campaign Types</br>
C.Campaign Templates</br>
D.Campaign Previews</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_012"/>
<div class="hidden_show_012">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To save different settings for various categories of Manager Access Reviews </br>
within User Manager Campaigns, a Campaign Owner can create C. Campaign Templates. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Campaign Templates: Templates allow you to pre-configure various settings </br>
for a campaign and save them as a reusable template. This includes settings related to:</br>
Campaign Scope: Defining which users, applications, or entitlements are included.</br>
Certifier Selection: Specifying the type of certifiers (e.g., Managers, Application Owners).</br>
Scheduling and Notifications: Setting up the campaign schedule and email notifications.</br>
Advanced Configurations: Including filters, risk scores, and other advanced settings.</br>
Multiple Templates for Different Categories: A Campaign Owner can create multiple templates,</br>
each tailored to a specific category of Manager Access Review. For example:</br>
Template 1: For high-risk applications, with stricter filters and more frequent reviews.</br>
Template 2: For low-risk applications, with broader scope and less frequent reviews.</br>
Template 3: For specific departments or business units, with customized certifier selection.</br>
Benefits of Using Templates:</br>
Consistency: Ensures that similar types of reviews are conducted consistently.</br>
Efficiency: Saves time by eliminating the need to configure each campaign from scratch.</br>
Reduced Errors: Minimizes the risk of manual configuration errors.</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
A. Global Configurations: Global configurations apply to all campaigns, </br>
not to specific categories of reviews.</br>
B. Campaign Types: Campaign types (e.g., User Manager, Entitlement Owner) </br>
define the overall purpose of the campaign, not the specific settings for different categories within a campaign type.</br>
D. Campaign Previews: Previews are for reviewing the campaign data before launch, </br>
not for saving different configurations.</br>
In conclusion: Campaign Templates in Saviynt provide a powerful way </br>
to save and reuse different configurations for various categories of </br>
Manager Access Reviews, promoting consistency, efficiency, and accuracy in the certification process.</br>

<div>Q13.As an Admin, you are required to set up an Entitlement Owner Campaign </br>
for Entitlements belonging to an Oracle ERP Endpoint by the Internal Audit team. </br>
The Campaign should be launched at the beginning of every month, and only Accounts </br>
and Entitlements that meet the prerequisites should be included in the Campaign.</br>
</br>
Which of the following 2-key configurations would you recommend for achieving this?</br>
A.Use Campaign Template and the Schedule Later option</br>
B.Use Advanced Configurations and Preview mode and create the Campaign at the beginning of each month</br>
C.Use Advanced Configurations and set the Campaign expiry to 31 days</br>
D.Cannot be achieved</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_013"/>
<div class="hidden_show_013">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
To set up an Entitlement Owner Campaign for Entitlements belonging to </br>
an Oracle ERP Endpoint that launches at the beginning of every month, and </br>
includes only Accounts and Entitlements that meet the prerequisites, </br>
the 2-key configurations you should recommend are A . Use Campaign Template and </br>
the Schedule Later option. Here's a breakdown:</br>
Campaign Template:</br>
Purpose: Templates allow you to save a set of campaign configurations as </br>
a reusable template. This is ideal for recurring campaigns with consistent settings.</br>
Benefits: Using a template saves time and ensures consistency across multiple campaign instances. </br>
You can define the scope (Oracle ERP Endpoint), Certifier type (Entitlement Owners), </br>
and other settings within the template.</br>
Prerequisites: You can include logic within the template to filter for Accounts and</br>
 Entitlements that meet the defined prerequisites.</br>
Schedule Later option:</br>
Purpose: This option allows you to schedule the campaign to launch at a specific date and time in the future.</br>
Recurring Scheduling: You can configure the campaign to run on a recurring schedule, such as the beginning of every month.</br>
Automation: This automates the campaign launch process, eliminating the need for manual intervention each month.</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
B. Use Advanced Configurations and Preview mode and create the Campaign at the beginning </br>
of each month: This approach is manual and prone to errors. It doesn't leverage the automation benefits of templates and scheduling.</br>
C. Use Advanced Configurations and set the Campaign expiry to 31 days: </br>
While setting an expiry is important, it doesn't address the need for recurring monthly launches </br>
or using a template for consistent configuration.</br>
D. Cannot be achieved: This is incorrect; the scenario can be easily </br>
achieved using Campaign Templates and the Schedule Later option.

<div>Q14.Which of the following actions is appropriate if the data displayed </br>
in the Campaign Preview mode does not meet the requirement?</br>
A.Re-configure Campaign</br>
B.Check Summary</br>
C.Export Campaign</br>
D.Activate Campaign</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_014"/>
<div class="hidden_show_014">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
If the data displayed in the Campaign Preview mode does not meet the requirement </br>
in Saviynt, the appropriate action is A. Re-configure Campaign. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Campaign Preview Mode: This mode allows administrators to </br>
review the data that will be included in a campaign before activating it. </br>
It's a crucial step for ensuring that the campaign scope, data, and configuration are correct.</br>
Purpose of Preview Mode: The primary purpose of the preview is </br>
to identify any issues or discrepancies in the campaign setup before it goes live.</br>
Re-configure Campaign: If the preview reveals problems (e.g., incorrect users or </br>
entitlements are included, the wrong Certifiers are assigned, </br>
filters are not working as expected), the administrator needs </br>
to go back and re-configure the campaign settings. This might involve:</br>
Adjusting the campaign scope.</br>
Modifying filters or selection criteria.</br>
Changing Certifier assignments.</br>
Updating the campaign schedule or notifications.</br>
Why Other Options Are Incorrect:</br>
B. Check Summary: The summary provides a high-level overview of the campaign,</br>
 but it doesn't allow for detailed data review like the preview mode.</br>
C. Export Campaign: Exporting the campaign data won't fix the underlying configuration issues.</br>
D. Activate Campaign: Activating a campaign with incorrect data would lead </br>
to inaccurate certification decisions and potential security risks.</br>
</div></br>




<div>Q15.To help users make informed and quick decisions, </br>
Saviynt provides filters for retrieving Certification data </br>
in the User Manager Campaign and Service Account Campaign.</br>
</br>
Which of the following options cannot be regarded as a Smart Filter?</br>
A.User's Assigned Role counts</br>
B.Access with SoD Violations</br>
C.Out-of-Band Access for Entitlements</br>
D.Risk Level for Accounts</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_015"/>
<div class="hidden_show_015">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The option that cannot be regarded as a Smart Filter in </br>
Saviynt's User Manager and Service Account Campaigns is A. User's Assigned Role counts. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Smart Filters: Smart Filters are pre-defined filters </br>
in Saviynt that help Certifiers quickly focus on specific access patterns </br>
or risk indicators during a certification campaign. They are designed </br>
to highlight potentially problematic or high-risk access.</br>
Examples of Smart Filters:</br>
B. Access with SoD Violations: This is a Smart Filter </br>
because it highlights access that violates Segregation of Duties policies, a significant risk indicator.</br>
C. Out-of-Band Access for Entitlements: This is a Smart Filter </br>
as it identifies access that was granted outside of the normal Saviynt processes, </br>
potentially indicating a security risk.</br>
D. Risk Level for Accounts: This is a Smart Filter </br>
because it allows Certifiers to focus on accounts with high-risk levels, which might require more scrutiny.</br>
Why 'User's Assigned Role counts' Is Not a Smart Filter:</br>
Not a Risk Indicator: Simply knowing the number of roles assigned </br>
to a user doesn't inherently indicate a risk or a specific access pattern </br>
that requires attention. A user might have many roles legitimately, </br>
or they might have few roles but with high-risk access.</br>
Not Actionable: This information alone doesn't provide enough context </br>
for a Certifier to make an informed decision about whether to approve or revoke access.</br>
Alternative: While not a 'Smart Filter', the number of roles assigned </br>
could be a data point displayed within the campaign, </br>
but it wouldn't be considered a pre-defined filter for highlighting risks.</br>

<div>Q16.Which of the following configurations can be used to allow Certifiers to certify their own access?</br>
A.Certify all users by default</br>
B.Show consult for own access</br>
C.Allow Self Certification</br>
D.Certification reassignment</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_016"/>
<div class="hidden_show_016">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
The configuration that can be used to allow Certifiers </br>
to certify their own access in a Saviynt Campaign is C. Allow Self Certification. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Campaign Configuration: Saviynt provides various configuration options </br>
to control the behavior of certification campaigns, including how self-certification is handled.</br>
'Allow Self Certification': This specific setting, when enabled, permits Certifiers </br>
to review and certify their own access within the campaign.</br>
Security Considerations: While enabling self-certification can streamline the process, </br>
it also introduces a potential security risk.</br>
 Organizations should carefully consider their risk tolerance and </br>
compliance requirements before enabling this option.</br>
Alternative Approaches: To mitigate the risks of self-certification, organizations might consider:</br>
Requiring additional approvals: Adding a second level of approval for self-certified items.</br>
Close monitoring: Implementing stricter monitoring and auditing of self-certified access.</br>
Disabling self-certification: In high-security environments, self-certification might be prohibited altogether.</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
A. Certify all users by default: This setting is not directly related to self-certification.</br>
B. Show consult for own access: This option usually allows a certifier </br>
to consult with another user before making a decision, but doesn't enable self certification.</br>
D. Certification reassignment: This allows for reassigning certification tasks </br>
to other users, but doesn't directly address self-certification.</br>
In conclusion: The 'Allow Self Certification' </br>
setting in a Saviynt campaign configuration directly controls </br>
whether Certifiers can certify their own access, providing flexibility</br>
 but requiring careful consideration of the associated security implications.</br>

<div>Q17.Which of the following Jobs is responsible for configuring a dashboard in a Campaign?</br>
A.Campaign Export Job</br>
B.Create or Schedule Attestation Job</br>
C.Campaign Import Job</br>
D.Upgrade Job</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_017"/>
<div class="hidden_show_017">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The Job responsible for configuring a dashboard (among other configurations) </br>
in a Saviynt Campaign is B. Create or Schedule Attestation Job. Here's a detailed explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Campaigns: Campaigns in Saviynt are used for access certification, </br>
allowing reviewers (Certifiers) to review and approve or revoke user access.</br>
Create or Schedule Attestation Job: This job is the core mechanism for creating </br>
and configuring various aspects of a campaign, including:</br>
Campaign Scope: Defining which users, entitlements, or resources are included in the campaign.</br>
Certifier Selection: Specifying who will be the reviewers for the campaign.</br>
Scheduling: Setting the start and end dates for the campaign.</br>
Notifications: Configuring email notifications for Certifiers and other stakeholders.</br>
Dashboard Configuration: Defining the information and layout displayed on </br>
the campaign dashboard for Certifiers. This includes selecting which data points, </br>
charts, and filters are visible.</br>
Why Other Options Are Incorrect:</br>
A. Campaign Export Job: This job is used to export campaign data, not to configure the campaign itself.</br>
C. Campaign Import Job: This job is used to import data into a campaign, typically from an external source.</br>
D. Upgrade Job: This job is related to upgrading the Saviynt platform, not to campaign configuration.</br>
In summary: The 'Create or Schedule Attestation Job' is the central job for setting up </br>
and configuring all aspects of a Saviynt campaign, including the dashboard that</br>
 provides Certifiers with a summarized view of the certification data.</br>

<div>Q18.Which of the following features best describe the Authorization mechanism for the EIC application?</br>
A.Security System</br>
B.SSO</br>
C.WSRETRY Job</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_017"/>
<div class="hidden_show_017">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The feature that best describes the Authorization mechanism </br>
for the EIC (Enterprise Identity Cloud) application in Saviynt is A. Security System. Here's an explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Security System: This is the core component within Saviynt that</br>
 handles authentication and authorization for various applications and resources, including EIC.</br>
Authorization in EIC: The Security System determines what actions users are allowed to perform within EIC, such as:</br>
Creating, updating, or deleting users.</br>
Managing roles and entitlements.</br>
Running reports.</br>
Configuring connections.</br>
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The Security System typically uses RBAC </br>
to manage these permissions. Users are assigned to roles, and roles are granted specific permissions within EIC.</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Relevant:</br>
B. SSO (Single Sign-On): SSO is an authentication mechanism that allows users </br>
to log in once and access multiple applications. While Saviynt supports SSO, </br>
it's not the primary authorization mechanism for EIC.</br>
C. WSRETRY Job: This is a job related to retrying web service calls, not authorization.</br>
</div></br>




<div>Q19.The following USER_IMPORT_MAPPING attribute is set up in Workday RAAS connection:</br>
USER_IMPORT_MAPPING</br>
{</br>
'ImportType': 'RAAS',</br>
'ResponsePath': 'wd:Report_Data.wd:Report_Entry',</br>
'ImportMapping': {</br>
'USERNAME': 'wd:User_Name~#~string',</br>
'SYSTEMUSERNAME': 'wd:User_Name~#~string',</br>
'FIRSTNAME': 'wd:First_Name~#~string',</br>
'CITY': 'wd:Location.wd:Descriptor~#~string'</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}</br>
}</br>
As per the above mapping, USERNAME is the user attribute defined in Workday,</br>
 and User_Name is the attribute defined in EIC.</br>
A.True</br>
B.False</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_019"/>
<div class="hidden_show_019">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The statement is False. In the provided USER_IMPORT_MAPPING, </br>
USERNAME is the user attribute defined in EIC (Enterprise Identity Cloud), </br>
and wd:User_Name is the attribute defined in Workday. Here's a breakdown:</br>
Saviynt's USER_IMPORT_MAPPING: This configuration </br>
within a connection (in this case, Workday RAAS) defines </br>
how data from the connected system (Workday) should be mapped to attributes within Saviynt's EIC.</br>
ImportMapping: This section specifies the mapping between source attributes (Workday) and target attributes (EIC).</br>
USERNAME: In the provided mapping, USERNAME (without the wd: prefix) is </br>
the target attribute, meaning it's an attribute within Saviynt's EIC.</br>
wd:User_Name: The wd: prefix typically indicates a Workday attribute.</br>
 Therefore, wd:User_Name is the source attribute from Workday.</br>
~#~string: This likely indicates the data type of the attribute (string in this case).</br>
Correct Interpretation: The mapping is saying: </br>
'Take the value of the wd:User_Name attribute from Workday and map it to the USERNAME attribute in EIC.'</br>
In essence: The USER_IMPORT_MAPPING defines how data from </br>
Workday is translated into Saviynt's internal data model, </br>
and in this case, USERNAME belongs to Saviynt (EIC), while wd:User_Name belongs to Workday.</br>
</div></br>

<div id="id3"></div>

<div>Q20.Which of the following connection types is best suited to expose Workday reports as a data service?</br>
A.Workday-RAAS</br>
B.Workday-REST</br>
C.Workday-OAuth</br>
D.Workday-SOAP</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_020"/>
<div class="hidden_show_020">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The connection type best suited to expose Workday reports as a data service in Saviynt is A. Workday-RAAS (Report as a Service). Here's why:</br>
Workday-RAAS: This connection type is specifically designed to integrate with Workday's RaaS functionality. Workday RaaS allows you to expose custom reports created within Workday as web services that can be consumed by external applications like Saviynt.</br>
ata Service for Reports: RaaS essentially turns a Workday report into a data service, making it easy to retrieve the report's data in a structured format (typically XML or JSON).</br>
Saviynt's Integration: Saviynt's Workday-RAAS connection type is built to leverage this capability, allowing you to:</br>
Select Workday Reports: Choose the specific Workday reports you want to integrate with.</br>
Import Data: Import the data from those reports into Saviynt for various purposes (e.g., identity governance, access certification, analytics).</br>
Schedule Imports: Schedule regular data imports to keep Saviynt's data synchronized with Workday.</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
B. Workday-REST: While Workday has a REST API, it's more general-purpose and not specifically tailored for exposing reports as data services in the same way as RaaS.</br>
C. Workday-OAuth: OAuth is an authorization protocol, not a connection type for retrieving report data.</br>
D. Workday-SOAP: Workday's SOAP API is being gradually replaced by the REST API and is less focused on report data retrieval than RaaS.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q21.Access privileges for any specific Analytical Control can be assigned using SAV Roles. Which of the following tasks can be performed, by default, by users belonging to an SAV Role?</br>
A.Only view the configurations of the Control</br>
B.View Control, Run Control, and View Analytic History of the Control</br>
C.Only view the Analytic History of the Control</br>
D.View Control and Run Control</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_021"/>
<div class="hidden_show_021">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
When access privileges for a specific Analytical Control are assigned using SAV Roles in Saviynt, users belonging to that role can, by default, perform the following tasks: B. View Control, Run Control, and View Analytic History of the Control. Here's a breakdown:</br>
Saviynt's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Saviynt uses RBAC to manage access to various features and functionalities, including Analytical Controls.</br>
Analytical Controls: These are pre-defined or custom-built analytics reports or dashboards.</br>
Default Permissions: When a user is granted access to an Analytical Control via an SAV Role, they typically receive a set of default permissions:</br>
View Control: Allows the user to view the configuration and definition of the Analytical Control (e.g., the query, parameters, visualization).</br>
Run Control: Allows the user to execute the Analytical Control and generate results.</br>
View Analytic History: Allows the user to see the history of previous executions of the Analytical Control, including the results and timestamps.</br>
Why These Permissions Are Important:</br>
Transparency: Users can understand how the analytics are defined and generated.</br>
Usability: Users can run the analytics and obtain insights.</br>
Auditing: Users can review past results for trend analysis or investigation.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A. Only view the configurations of the Control: This is too restrictive; users need to be able to run the control to get value from it.</br>
C. Only view the Analytic History of the Control: This is also too limited; users should be able to run the control and view its configuration as well.</br>
D. View Control and Run Control: While closer, it's missing the 'View Analytic History' permission, which is important for auditing and analysis.</br>

<div>Q22.Which of the following formats is suitable for downloading an Analytics report? (Select all that apply)</br>
A.CSV file and Excel Sheet</br>
B.Text file</br>
C.CSV file only</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_022"/>
<div class="hidden_show_022">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The formats suitable for downloading an Analytics report in Saviynt typically include A. CSV file and Excel Sheet. Here's an explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Reporting Capabilities: Saviynt provides options for exporting and downloading analytics reports in various formats to facilitate data sharing and further analysis.</br>
Common Export Formats:</br>
CSV (Comma Separated Values): A widely used format for storing tabular data in plain text. It's easily imported into various data analysis tools and spreadsheet programs.</br>
Excel Sheet (e.g., .xlsx): A popular spreadsheet format that allows for data organization, formatting, and calculations.</br>
Why These Formats Are Suitable:</br>
Data Analysis: Both CSV and Excel formats are well-suited for further data analysis and manipulation.</br>
Reporting: They are commonly used for creating reports and sharing data with stakeholders.</br>
Compatibility: Most data analysis and reporting tools support these formats.</br>
Other Less Common Options: While less frequent, Saviynt might offer other export formats like PDF, depending on the specific version and configuration.</br>
B. Text file: Although technically a text file, a raw .txt export might not be as useful for structured data like analytics reports. CSV would be preferred.</br>
In conclusion: CSV and Excel are the most common and practical formats for downloading analytics reports from Saviynt, offering flexibility for data analysis, reporting, and sharing.</br>

<div>Q23.How can a single report be configured to display the account attributes of all the accounts to Application Owners?</br>
A.Use Elasticsearch Query</br>
B.V2 Analytics using SQL Query with External Connection</br>
C.V2 Analytics using SQL Query with Allowed Action</br>
D.V2 Analytics using SQL Query with User Context</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_023"/>
<div class="hidden_show_023">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
To configure a single report that displays the account attributes of all the accounts to their respective Application Owners in Saviynt, the best approach is D. V2 Analytics using SQL Query with User Context. Here's a breakdown:</br>
Saviynt's Analytics V2: This is Saviynt's newer analytics platform, offering more advanced features and flexibility compared to the older version.</br>
SQL Query with User Context: This is the key to achieving the desired outcome. 'User Context' means that the query will be executed in the context of the currently logged-in user (in this case, the Application Owner).</br>
How it Works:</br>
Dynamic Filtering: When an Application Owner runs the report, the 'User Context' will automatically filter the data to show only the accounts that they own.</br>
Security and Data Privacy: This ensures that each Application Owner only sees the data that they are authorized to access.</br>
SQL Query Structure: The SQL query would likely involve a JOIN between the accounts table and a table that defines application ownership (e.g., applications), using a WHERE clause that filters based on the current user's ID or username. Something like this (syntax might need adjustment for Saviynt's specific SQL dialect):</br>
SELECT a.*</br>
FROM accounts a</br>
JOIN applications app ON a.application_id = app.application_id</br>
WHERE app.owner_id = ${CURRENT_USER_ID} -- This is the user context part</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
A. Use Elasticsearch Query: While Elasticsearch can be used for analytics, it might not be the best tool for this specific requirement, as it doesn't inherently support the concept of 'User Context' in the same way as SQL queries in Analytics V2.</br>
B. V2 Analytics using SQL Query with External Connection: External connections are used to query data from external databases, which is not necessary in this scenario.</br>
C. V2 Analytics using SQL Query with Allowed Action: Allowed Actions are used to define actions that can be performed on analytics results, not for filtering data based on user context.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q24.Multiple indices can be selected while creating Analytics using the Elasticsearch Query.</br>
A.True</br>
B.False</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_024"/>
<div class="hidden_show_024">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
It is True that multiple indices can be selected while creating Analytics using the Elasticsearch Query in Saviynt. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Analytics and Elasticsearch: Saviynt's analytics capabilities are often built on top of Elasticsearch, a powerful search and analytics engine.</br>
Indices in Elasticsearch: In Elasticsearch, an index is like a database table. It's a collection of documents with similar characteristics. Saviynt uses indices to store various types of data, such as user data, account data, entitlement data, and event logs.</br>
Multi-Index Queries: Elasticsearch allows you to query across multiple indices simultaneously. This is a fundamental feature of the search engine.</br>
Saviynt's Interface: When creating analytics in Saviynt using Elasticsearch queries, the interface typically allows you to select multiple indices as the data source for your analysis.</br>
Use Cases: This capability is essential for creating comprehensive analytics that span different data domains. For example, you might want to analyze user access patterns (from one index) in conjunction with application usage data (from another index).</br>
In conclusion: The ability to select multiple indices is a core feature of Elasticsearch and is supported within Saviynt's analytics interface,</br>

<div>Q25.What triggers a Request Rule?</br>
A.When a user is imported</br>
B.When Access Request is created and matches the conditions</br>
C.When the Run Detective Rule job is run</br>
D.When changes are detected in the import</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_025"/>
<div class="hidden_show_025">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
A Request Rule in Saviynt is triggered B. When an Access Request is created and matches the conditions. Here's a detailed explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Request Rules: Request Rules are a type of rule specifically designed to govern the access request process.</br>
Triggering Event: The primary trigger for a Request Rule is the creation of a new access request within Saviynt's Access Request System (ARS).</br>
Condition Evaluation: When a new request is submitted, Saviynt evaluates the conditions defined in any applicable Request Rules. These conditions can be based on:</br>
Requester Attributes: (e.g., department, location, job title)</br>
Beneficiary Attributes: (if the request is for another user)</br>
Requested Resource: (e.g., application, role, entitlement)</br>
Request Details: (e.g., requested start/end dates)</br>
Rule Actions: If the conditions of a Request Rule are met, the rule's defined actions are executed. These actions can include:</br>
Modifying the request: (e.g., adding approvers, changing the approval workflow)</br>
Auto-approving or auto-rejecting the request:</br>
Generating notifications:</br>
Triggering other workflows:</br>
Other Options:</br>
A. When a user is imported: This might trigger User Update Rules or birthright rules, but not Request Rules.</br>
C. When the Run Detective Rule job is run: This job evaluates detective rules, not Request Rules.</br>
D . When changes are detected in the import: This could trigger various rules, but not specifically Request Rules.</br>

<div>Q26.As part of a recent organizational change, John, a Security Consultant, was moved from Department A to B. To follow the Least Privilege Principle, there is a requirement to certify all existing entitlements of John by relevant stakeholders. Now, you have configured a User Update Rule to launch a certification when the department changes. Which of the following actions will you configure to support this scenario?</br>
A.Launch Manager Campaign</br>
B.Launch Service Account Campaign</br>
C.Launch Entitlement Owner Campaign</br>
D.Launch Organization Owner Campaign</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_026"/>
<div class="hidden_show_026">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To certify all existing entitlements of John by relevant stakeholders after he moves from Department A to B, and you have a User Update Rule to trigger a certification, the action you should configure is C. Launch Entitlement Owner Campaign. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Certification Campaigns: Saviynt supports various types of certification campaigns to review and validate user access.</br>
Entitlement Owner Campaign: This specific campaign type is designed to have the owners of entitlements (typically application or business owners) review and certify the users who have access to those entitlements.</br>
User Update Rule Trigger: The User Update Rule, triggered by the department change, can initiate the certification process.</br>
Least Privilege Principle: This approach aligns with the principle of least privilege by ensuring that access is regularly reviewed and validated, especially after significant changes like a department transfer.</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</br>
A. Launch Manager Campaign: While manager campaigns are useful, they might not be the most appropriate in this case. Entitlement owners are generally more knowledgeable about who should have access to specific entitlements.</br>
B. Launch Service Account Campaign: This is for certifying service accounts, not user entitlements.</br>
D. Launch Organization Owner Campaign: This is not a standard campaign type in Saviynt and might not be relevant to certifying user entitlements.</br>
In conclusion: Launching an Entitlement Owner Campaign from a User Update Rule triggered by a department change is the most effective way to ensure that John's existing entitlements are reviewed and certified by the appropriate stakeholders, adhering to the principle of least privilege.</br>

<div>Q27.Which of the following should be enabled in the User Update Rule when the Rule has to be applied for an existing user?</br>
A.Trigger when user is created from import</br>
B.Retrofit rule actions for users</br>
C.Trigger when user is updated from import</br>
D.Action > Rerun All Provisioning Rules</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_027"/>
<div class="hidden_show_027">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
To apply a User Update Rule to existing users in Saviynt, you should enable the option B. Retrofit rule actions for users. Here's an explanation:</br>
Saviynt's User Update Rules - Initial Application: When a User Update Rule is created, it typically applies to users who are newly created or updated after the rule is put in place.</br>
Retrofit Functionality: The 'Retrofit rule actions for users' option allows you to apply the rule retroactively to users who already exist in the system and meet the rule's conditions.</br>
How it Works: When enabled, Saviynt will evaluate the rule against all existing users. If a user matches the rule's conditions, the defined actions (e.g., assigning roles, updating attributes) will be applied to that user, even if they were created before the rule.</br>
Use Cases: This is useful when you create a new rule that should have been in place all along, or when you need to make a broad change to existing user configurations based on a new policy.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A. Trigger when user is created from import: This applies the rule to new users imported into Saviynt, not existing users.</br>
C. Trigger when user is updated from import: This applies the rule when existing users are updated via import, but it won't necessarily apply to all existing users who meet the conditions.</br>
D. Action > Rerun All Provisioning Rules: This action is more general and might not be the most efficient way to apply a specific User Update Rule retroactively.</br>
In summary: The 'Retrofit rule actions for users' setting within a Saviynt User Update Rule is crucial for applying the rule's logic and actions to existing users, ensuring consistent configuration across the user base.</br>

<div>Q28.What does the following image signify?</br>
Assigning of Enterprise Role based on a dynamic variable city.</br>
A.ssigning of Enterprise Role based on users' department</br>
B.Assigning of Enterprise Role based on users' location</br>
C.Assigning of Enterprise Role based on concatenation of dynamic variable city and Finance</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_028"/>
<div class="hidden_show_028">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The image signifies B. Assigning of Enterprise Role based on users' location. Here's a breakdown, assuming the image depicts a portion of a Saviynt User Update Rule configuration:</br>
Dynamic Variable 'City': The image highlights the use of a dynamic variable called 'city.' This strongly suggests that the rule is using the user's location (city) as a key factor in determining role assignment.</br>
Saviynt's User Update Rules and Dynamic Variables: User Update Rules in Saviynt allow for the use of dynamic variables, which represent user attributes. These variables can be used in conditions and actions within the rule.</br>
Enterprise Role Assignment: The context of the question implies that the rule is assigning an Enterprise Role based on the value of this 'city' variable.</br>
Example: The rule might be configured to assign an Enterprise Role like 'Sydney-Users' to users whose 'city' attribute is 'Sydney.'</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Likely:</br>
A. Assigning of Enterprise Role based on users' department: There's no mention of 'department' in the provided information.</br>
C. Assigning of Enterprise Role based on concatenation of dynamic variable city and Finance: While concatenation is possible in Saviynt, there's no indication that 'Finance' is involved here. The focus seems to be solely on the 'city' variable.</br>
In conclusion: Based on the information given, the image most likely represents a Saviynt User Update Rule that assigns an Enterprise Role based on the user's location, as indicated by the dynamic variable 'city.</br>
</div></br>


<div>Q29.John, who recently joined an organization as a full-time employee, is required to work from the Sydney office. He was assigned birthright entitlements as part of the new joiner provisioning. Which of the following Enterprise Roles will be assigned to John from the Birthright Rule?</br>
A. Birthright - Sydney</br>
B. Birthright - Permanent - Full-time</br>
C. Birthright - All</br>
D. Birthright - Employee</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_029"/>
<div class="hidden_show_029">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
In this scenario, where John is a new full-time employee required to work from the Sydney office, the most specific and appropriate Enterprise Role assigned from the Birthright Rule would likely be A. Birthright - Sydney. Here's the reasoning:</br>
Saviynt's Birthright Roles and Rules: Birthright roles are designed to automatically provision access based on specific criteria like location, job role, or employment type. Birthright rules define the conditions for assigning these roles.</br>
Specificity of Role Assignment: The goal is to assign the most relevant and granular role based on the available information. In this case, John's location (Sydney) is the most specific criterion mentioned.</br>
Why Other Options Are Less Likely:</br>
B. Birthright - Permanent - Full-time: While John is a full-time employee, this role might be too broad if there are other location-specific roles.</br>
C. Birthright - All: This role is likely too generic and would grant excessive access. It's generally not good practice to have an 'all-encompassing' birthright role.</br>
D. Birthright - Employee: Similar to the 'Full-time' role, this might be too broad if location-specific roles are available.</br>
Best Practices: It's a best practice in identity governance to use the most specific criteria possible when assigning birthright access. This helps enforce the principle of least privilege.</br>
In summary: The 'Birthright - Sydney' role is the most appropriate choice because it aligns with John's specific work location, ensuring he receives the necessary access for his role while adhering to the principle of least privilege.</br>

<div>Q30.Which of the following Jobs should be created and scheduled to evaluate Rules on a need basis?</br>
A.Run Detective Rules and Take Action</br>
B.Provisioning Job</br>
C.User Import via Connection</br>
D.Trigger Chain Job</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_030"/>
<div class="hidden_show_030">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The Job that should be created and scheduled to evaluate Rules on a need basis in Saviynt is A . Run Detective Rules and Take Action. Here's an explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Jobs: Saviynt uses Jobs to perform various tasks, including data imports, rule evaluations, and provisioning operations.</br>
'Run Detective Rules and Take Action': This specific job is designed to:</br>
Evaluate Rules: It evaluates rules that are configured for detective (monitoring) purposes. These rules typically check for specific conditions or changes in user attributes, access rights, or other data.</br>
Take Action (Optional): Based on the rule evaluation results, the job can be configured to automatically take actions, such as:</br>
Generating alerts or notifications.</br>
Creating tasks for administrators to review.</br>
Triggering workflows.</br>
Automatically remediating issues (e.g., revoking access if a rule detects a violation).</br>
Scheduling: This job can be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., daily, hourly) to continuously monitor for changes and enforce defined rules.</br>
On-Demand Execution: You can also run this job on-demand to evaluate rules immediately.</br>
Other Options:</br>
B. Provisioning Job: This job is primarily used for provisioning access to target systems, not for evaluating general-purpose rules.</br>
C. User Import via Connection: This job is for importing user data from external sources.</br>
D. Trigger Chain Job: This allows for running a series or 'chain' of jobs, but it doesn't directly evaluate rules itself.</br>
</div></br>


<div>Q31.Which of the following objects is available in the User Update Rule to configure Rule conditions?</br>
A.Users</br>
B.Accounts</br>
C.Roles</br>
D.Entitlements</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_031"/>
<div class="hidden_show_031">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The object that is available in the User Update Rule to configure Rule conditions in Saviynt is A . Users. Here's an explanation:</br>
User Update Rule Purpose: As mentioned before, User Update Rules are used to automatically update user attributes based on certain conditions.</br>
Condition Based on User Attributes: The conditions for triggering a User Update Rule are primarily based on attributes of the User object itself.</br>
Examples of User Attributes: These attributes can include:</br>
User Status: (e.g., Active, Inactive, Disabled)</br>
Department:</br>
Location:</br>
Job Title:</br>
Manager:</br>
Custom Attributes: Any custom attributes defined for users in your Saviynt environment.</br>
Triggering the Rule: When a user's attributes change, and those changes match the conditions defined in a User Update Rule, the rule is triggered.</br>
Other Options:</br>
B. Accounts: While account attributes can be updated as an action of a User Update Rule, the conditions for triggering the rule are typically based on user attributes, not account attributes.</br>
C. Roles: Similar to accounts, roles can be assigned or removed as an action of a User Update Rule, but the triggering conditions are usually based on user attributes.</br>
D. Entitlements: Entitlements are also typically managed as an action of a User Update Rule, not as part of the triggering condition.</br>
In conclusion: The User object and its attributes are the primary focus for defining conditions within a Saviynt User Update Rule. Changes to user attributes trigger the rule, which can then perform actions such as updating other user attributes, accounts, roles, or entitlements.</br>
</div></br>


<div>Q32.Which of the following Rules should always be used in conjunction with the Organization object?</br>
A.Technical Rule</br>
B.User Update Rule</br>
C.Scan Rule</br>
D.Request Rule</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_032"/>
<div class="hidden_show_032">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The type of Rule that should always be used in conjunction with the Organization object in Saviynt is the B. User Update Rule. Here's the explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Organization Object: The Organization object in Saviynt represents the organizational structure or hierarchy (e.g., departments, locations, cost centers). It's often used to define relationships between users and organizational units.</br>
User Update Rule: This type of rule is designed to automatically update user attributes based on changes in other user attributes or related objects.</br>
Using Organization with User Update Rule: The User Update Rule is frequently used with the Organization object to automate user management based on organizational changes.</br>
Example: You can create a User Update Rule that automatically assigns users to specific roles or groups based on their department (defined in the Organization object). If a user is moved to a different department, the rule will trigger and update their roles or group memberships accordingly.</br>
Dynamic User Management: This combination enables dynamic user management, ensuring that user attributes and access rights are automatically adjusted as users move within the organization.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A. Technical Rule: Technical Rules are more general-purpose and can be used for various tasks, but they are not specifically tied to the Organization object.</br>
C. Scan Rule: Scan Rules are used for data analysis and identifying potential issues, not for updating user attributes based on organizational structure.</br>
D. Request Rule: Request Rules are related to access request workflows, not to automatic user updates.</br>
In essence: The User Update Rule, when used in conjunction with the Organization object, provides a powerful way to automate user management in Saviynt, ensuring that user attributes and access rights are dynamically updated based on changes in the organizational structure.</br>
</div></br>

<div>Q33 Where can an Admin get the details of a successfully executed Rule?　</br>
A. Archived Rule Trail</br>
B. Archived Application Logs</br>
C. Current Rule Trail</br>
D. Action Trail</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_033"/>
<div class="hidden_show_033">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To get the details of a successfully executed Rule in Saviynt, an Admin should look in the C. Current Rule Trail. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Rule Engine and Logging: Saviynt's rule engine executes various types of rules (e.g., birthright rules, user update rules, technical rules). </br>
It maintains logs to track rule execution and outcomes.</br>
Current Rule Trail: This log specifically captures the details of recently executed rules, including:</br>
Rule Name: The name of the rule that was executed.</br>
Execution Time: The timestamp of when the rule was executed.</br>
Status: Whether the rule execution was successful or not.</br>
Details: Specific information about the rule's execution, such as the conditions that were evaluated and the actions that were taken.</br>
Troubleshooting and Auditing: The Current Rule Trail is invaluable for troubleshooting rule behavior and for auditing purposes, providing a clear record of what rules were executed and their results.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A. Archived Rule Trail: This log stores details of older rule executions that have been archived. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's useful for historical analysis but not for recent executions.</br>
B. Archived Application Logs: These logs are related to application activity, not rule execution.</br>
D. Action Trail: The Action Trail captures general user and administrative actions within Saviynt, </br>
but it might not provide the detailed information about rule execution that the Current Rule Trail does.</br>
</div></br>




<div>Q34 Adam, an Admin, created a rule to provide birthright access; however, the access should be deprovisioned when the condition fails. </br>
Which of the following options should be applied for this scenario?　</br>
A. Remove the Access Rule</br>
B. Apply a new Technical Rule to remove the Access</br>
C. Remove the birthright Access if the condition fails under the created Rule</br>
D. Use the Request Rule</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_034"/>
<div class="hidden_show_034">
</br>
Answer: C
Explanation:
To automatically deprovision birthright access when the defining condition fails, </br>
the correct option is C. Remove the birthright Access if the condition fails under the created Rule. Here's a detailed explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Birthright Access (Automatic Provisioning): Saviynt allows administrators to define rules </br>
that automatically grant access (birthright access) based on user attributes or </br>
other criteria (e.g., new hires in a specific department automatically get access to certain applications).</br>
Rule-Based Access Management: These rules are a core part of Saviynt's access management capabilities, allowing for dynamic and automated provisioning.
'Remove the birthright Access if the condition fails': This option, typically found within the birthright rule configuration itself, is crucial for ensuring that access is revoked when the conditions that granted it are no longer met.</br>
Example: If a user is granted access to an application because they are in the 'Sales' department, and they are later moved to the 'Marketing' department, the condition for the birthright rule would fail, and Saviynt would automatically deprovision the access.</br>
Saviynt's Continuous Monitoring: Saviynt continuously monitors user attributes and rule conditions. When a change occurs that causes a condition to fail, the deprovisioning action is triggered.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A . Remove the Access Rule: This would remove the entire rule, preventing it from granting access to anyone, not just the user whose condition has failed.</br>
B . Apply a new Technical Rule to remove the Access: While technically possible, it's less efficient and more complex than using the built-in option within the </bbirthright rule.</br>
D . Use the Request Rule: Request Rules are for access requests, not for automatically provisioning or deprovisioning birthright access.
</div></br>


<div>Q35 What is the purpose of a Custom Assignment Workflow block?　</br>
A. Request must be approved based on any attribute of a user or account, or a custom condition</br>
B. Request must be approved by the Role Owner</br>
C. Request must be approved by the Application Owner</br>
D. None of the above</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_035"/>
<div class="hidden_show_035">
</br>
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The purpose of a Custom Assignment Workflow block in Saviynt is A. Request must be approved based on any attribute of a user or account, or a custom condition. Here's a detailed explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Workflow Flexibility: Saviynt's workflow engine is designed to be highly flexible, allowing organizations to create complex approval processes tailored to their specific needs.</br>
Standard Approver Types: While Saviynt provides standard approver types like Manager, Role Owner, and Application Owner, there are often scenarios where the approval needs to be routed based on more dynamic or complex criteria.</br>
Custom Assignment Block: This is where the 'Custom Assignment' block comes in. It allows you to define custom logic to determine the approver(s) for a request.</br>
Attribute-Based Approvals: You can use attributes of the requester, the beneficiary (if different), or even attributes of the requested resource (e.g., application, entitlement) to determine the approver. For example:</br>
Requests from users in a specific department could be routed to a particular security officer.</br>
Requests for access to a high-risk application could be routed to a specific risk management team.</br>
Custom Conditions: You can also define custom conditions using scripting or other logic within the Custom Assignment block. This allows for even greater flexibility in defining the approval routing.</br>
Example: You might have a condition that checks if the requested entitlement has a certain risk level and, if so, routes the approval to a specific compliance officer.</br>
Other Options:</br>
B . Request must be approved by the Role Owner: This is handled by a standard 'TASK Access Approve' activity assigned to the Role Owner.</br>
C . Request must be approved by the Application Owner: Similar to the above, this is a standard approver type.</br>
D . None of the above: Option A accurately describes the purpose of the Custom Assignment block.</br>

<div>Q36 The Sales department of a company requires an approval workflow to be created for an application where the Manager's approval should be followed by the Application Owner's approval. Which of the following sequences form the correct order of the workflow events?　</br>
A. Start > Resource Owner's Approval > Manager's Approval > Approve/Reject > End</br>
B. Start > Manager's Approval > Custom Assignment > Approve/Reject > End</br>
C. Start > Manager's Approval > Access Approval > Approve/Reject > End</br>
D. Start > Manager's Approval > Resource Owner's Approval > Approve/Reject > End</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_036"/>
<div class="hidden_show_036">
</br>
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
The correct sequence of workflow events for an application </br>
where the Manager's approval should be followed by </br>
the Application Owner's approval is D. Start > Manager's Approval > Resource Owner's Approval > Approve/Reject > End. Here's a breakdown:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Workflow Structure: Saviynt workflows follow a sequential structure, starting with a 'Start' event and ending with an 'End' event.</br>
Workflow Activities: Each step in the workflow is represented by an activity, such as an approval task.</br>
Manager's Approval: In this scenario, the first required approval is from the Manager. This would be represented </br>
by a 'TASK Access Approve' activity (or similar, depending on the specific configuration) assigned to the user's manager.</br>
Application Owner's Approval: After the Manager's approval, the workflow needs to proceed to the Application Owner for their approval. </br>
This would be another 'TASK Access Approve' activity assigned to the Application Owner. </br>
In Saviynt terms, Application Owner is a type of Resource Owner.</br>
Approve/Reject: This activity represents the decision point where the final approver (in this case, </br>
the Application Owner) either approves or rejects the request.</br>
End: The workflow concludes with the 'End' event, signifying the completion of the process.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A . Start > Resource Owner's Approval > Manager's Approval > Approve/Reject > End: Incorrect order; the manager's approval should come before the application owner's.</br>
B . Start > Manager's Approval > Custom Assignment > Approve/Reject > End: 'Custom Assignment' is not the most appropriate activity for a standard approval step. 'TASK Access Approve' would be more suitable.</br>
C . Start > Manager's Approval > Access Approval > Approve/Reject > End: 'Access Approval' is a bit redundant; 'TASK Access Approve' assigned to the appropriate role is clearer.</br>
In essence: The correct workflow sequence accurately reflects the required approval hierarchy: first the Manager, then the Application Owner, followed by the final decision (Approve/Reject) and the end of the workflow.</br>
</div></br>


<div>Q37 Which of the following bulk operations is not a supported feature?　</br>
A. Bulk Request Access Request for multiple users in a single request</br>
B. Disabling multiple users and their access</br>
C. Bulk Approval - Single-click approval for multiple entitlements in a single request</br>
D. Deleting multiple users</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_037"/>
<div class="hidden_show_037">
</br>
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
The bulk operation that is not typically a supported feature in the same way as the others is C. Bulk Approval - Single-click approval for multiple entitlements in a single request. Here's why:</br>
</br>
Saviynt's Bulk Operations: Saviynt supports various bulk operations to streamline administration and user experience, especially when dealing with multiple users or requests.</br>
Supported Bulk Operations:</br>
A . Bulk Request Access: Saviynt allows users to request access for multiple users in a single request. This is a common and supported feature.</br>
B . Disabling multiple users and their access: Administrators can disable multiple user accounts and revoke their access in bulk.</br>
D . Deleting multiple users: Saviynt supports the bulk deletion of user accounts.</br>
Bulk Approval - Granularity: While Saviynt supports bulk approvals (approving multiple requests at once), it typically operates at the request level, not at the individual entitlement level within a single request. Approving multiple separate requests in one go is a standard bulk approval action.</br>
Each request (even if it's a bulk request for multiple users or contains multiple entitlements) is usually treated as a single unit for approval.</br>
Approvers typically approve or reject the entire request, not individual entitlements within it.</br>
Security and Control: This approach maintains better control and auditability. Approving each entitlement within a single request individually would require a more complex interface and potentially increase the risk of accidental approvals.</br>
</br>
Possible Workarounds:</br>
Separate Requests: To achieve a similar outcome, users could submit separate requests for each entitlement, allowing the approver to approve them individually (and potentially in bulk if they are separate requests).</br>
Custom Workflows: In theory, it might be possible to create highly customized workflows to handle this scenario, but it's not a standard out-of-the-box feature.</br>
In summary: While Saviynt excels at bulk operations for users and requests, single-click approval of individual entitlements within a single request is not a typical supported feature due to the need for granular control and a clear audit trail. Bulk approvals usually apply to entire requests, not to individual entitlements within them.</br>

<div>Q38 ABC Company intends to implement a workflow that involves Saviynt User Group's approval. Which of the following Workflow blocks is appropriate for this implementation?　</br>
A. CONDITION IF Else</br>
B. TASK Access Approve</br>
C. Action Prompt</br>
D. TASK Custom Assignment</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_038"/>
<div class="hidden_show_038">
</br>
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
To implement a workflow involving a Saviynt User Group's approval, the appropriate workflow block is B. TASK Access Approve. Here's an explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Workflow Engine: Saviynt's workflow engine allows for the creation of complex approval processes using various building blocks or activities.</br>
TASK Access Approve: This specific activity is designed to handle approval steps within a workflow. It allows you to define who the approver(s) should be and how the approval should be processed.</br>
User Group Approval: To implement approval by a Saviynt User Group, you would configure the 'TASK Access Approve' activity as follows:</br>
Approver Type: You would select 'User Group' as the approver type.</br>
User Group Selection: You would then specify the particular Saviynt User Group that should be responsible for the approval.</br>
Approval Logic: You can define whether all members of the group must approve, or if a certain number or percentage of approvals is sufficient.</br>
Saviynt User Groups: User Groups in Saviynt are collections of users, often based on department, role, or other criteria. They are useful for managing access and approvals at a group level.</br>

Other Options:</br>
A . CONDITION IF Else: This block is used for branching logic in a workflow, not specifically for assigning approvals to user groups.</br>
C . Action Prompt: This might be used for displaying information or collecting input, but not for defining an approval step.</br>
D . TASK Custom Assignment: While you could potentially use custom assignment with scripting to achieve user group approval, the 'TASK Access Approve' activity provides a more straightforward and built-in way to do it.</br>
In conclusion: The 'TASK Access Approve' workflow block in Saviynt, configured with a User Group as the approver type, is the most appropriate and direct way to implement a workflow that requires approval from a specific Saviynt User Group.

<div>Q39 ABC Company has set up a one-level workflow for an application, where the lone approver is the manager of the beneficiary. Margaret, who is Edward's manager, raised an access request on behalf of Edward. Which of the following statements would be true/applicable?</br>
A. Manager's approval is auto-approved</br>
B. Manager's approval is auto-rejected</br>
C. Manager must manually approve/reject the request</br>
D. None of the above</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_039"/>
<div class="hidden_show_039">
</br>
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
In the given scenario, where ABC Company has a one-level workflow with the manager as the sole approver, and Margaret (Edward's manager) raises a request on behalf of Edward, the statement that would be true/applicable is A. Manager's approval is auto-approved. Here's why:</br>
Saviynt's Workflow Configuration: Saviynt allows for the configuration of various workflow scenarios, including auto-approval based on certain conditions.</br>
Self-Approval Prevention/Auto-Approval: A common security best practice is to prevent users from approving their own access requests. However, </br>
when a manager requests on behalf of a subordinate, this is considered a delegated request and many organizations find it acceptable to</br>
 auto-approve since the approval should be implicit in the act of requesting.</br>
Manager Requesting on Behalf: When a manager initiates a request for a subordinate, </br>
it's often considered an implicit approval. The manager is essentially saying, 'I approve this access for my team member.'</br>
Saviynt's Default Behavior (Typically): By default, or through common configuration practices, Saviynt is </br>
often set up to recognize this scenario and auto-approve the manager's approval step in the workflow. </br>
This streamlines the process and avoids unnecessary delays.</br>
Configuration Options: While auto-approval is common, Saviynt's workflow engine is flexible. It's possible to configure it differently, </br>
for instance, to still require explicit manager approval even in this scenario. However, this is less typical.</br>
Other Options:</br>
B. Manager's approval is auto-rejected: This is highly unlikely and would defeat the purpose of having a manager initiate the request.</br>
C. Manager must manually approve/reject the request: While possible through configuration, it's not the typical or default behavior in this scenario.</br>
D. None of the above: Option A is the most likely and common outcome.</br>
In summary: In a one-level workflow where the manager is the approver, and the manager requests access on behalf of a subordinate, </br>
Saviynt is typically configured to auto-approve the manager's approval step, streamlining the process and</br>
 reflecting the implicit approval inherent in the manager's action.

<div>Q40 ________ allows detection of access rights granted outside the Saviynt platform.　</br>
A. REST API</br>
B. RevokeOutOfBandAccessJob</br>
C. Bulk Upload</br>
D. ARS > Request Access for Others</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_040"/>
<div class="hidden_show_040">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The Saviynt feature that allows detection of access rights granted outside the Saviynt platform is the B. RevokeOutOfBandAccessJob. </br>
Here's a detailed explanation:</br>
Out-of-Band Access: This refers to access that is provisioned directly in the target system, </br>
bypassing the normal access request and approval processes within Saviynt. This can create security risks and compliance issues.</br>
Saviynt's Reconciliation Process: Saviynt uses a reconciliation process to compare the access rights defined within its system with the actual access rights present in connected applications.</br>
RevokeOutOfBandAccessJob: This specific job is designed to identify and flag out-of-band access. It works by:</br>
Importing Account and Entitlement Data: The job imports data from the target system, capturing the current state of user access.</br>
Comparing with Saviynt Data: It compares this imported data with the access rights managed within Saviynt.</br>
Identifying Discrepancies: Any discrepancies, where a user has access in the target system that wasn't granted through Saviynt, </br>
are identified as out-of-band access.</br>
Taking Action (Optional): The job can be configured to automatically revoke this out-of-band access or </br>
to simply generate a report for review and manual remediation. Or it can be configured to create a task for an administrator to review.</br>
Saviynt's Access Governance: This feature is a crucial part of Saviynt's overall access governance capabilities, helping organizations maintain control over user access and enforce the principle of least privilege.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A. REST API: While Saviynt's REST API can be used to interact with the system and potentially retrieve access data, it's not the specific feature designed for out-of-band access detection.</br>
C. Bulk Upload: This is a method for importing data into Saviynt, but it doesn't inherently detect out-of-band access.</br>
D. ARS > Request Access for Others: This is part of the access request process, not related to detecting access granted outside of Saviynt.</br>
In conclusion: The RevokeOutOfBandAccessJob in Saviynt plays a vital role in identifying and remediating out-of-band access, ensuring that access rights are managed centrally and consistently through the Saviynt platform.</br>

<div>Q41 Which of the following configurations on Entitlement Type is used to make an Entitlement request time-bound?</br>
A. Ask for Start Date while revoking</br>
B. Allow update of Access End Date</br>
C. Config JSON for Request Dates</br>
D. Start Date/End Date while raising a Request</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_041"/>
<div class="hidden_show_041">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
To make an Entitlement request time-bound in Saviynt, the configuration used on the Entitlement Type is D.</br>
 Start Date/End Date while raising a Request. Here's a breakdown:</br>
Saviynt's Entitlement Management: Entitlements represent specific access rights within an application. Saviynt allows fine-grained control over how these entitlements are requested and granted.</br>
Entitlement Type Configuration: Within Saviynt, each Entitlement Type can be configured with various settings </br>
that govern its behavior during access requests.
Time-Bound Access: To enforce time-limited access, Saviynt provides the option to require a Start Date and End Date during the request process.</br>
'Start Date/End Date while raising a Request': This configuration setting, when enabled on an Entitlement Type, forces the requester </br>
to specify a desired start and end date for the access. This ensures that the granted access will only be valid for a specific period.</br>
Saviynt's Workflow Engine and Provisioning: When a request with a start and end date is approved, </br>
Saviynt's workflow engine will typically handle the provisioning and de-provisioning based on these dates. </br>
If connected integration is set up, it may schedule the activation and deactivation of the access in the target system accordingly.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A. Ask for Start Date while revoking: This setting is related to revoking access, not granting time-bound access.</br>
B. Allow update of Access End Date: This allows modification of the end date after the access has been granted, </br>
but it doesn't enforce a time-bound request from the outset.</br>
C. Config JSON for Request Dates: While JSON might be used internally for configuration, </br>
this is not the specific setting that directly enables time-bound access requests.</br>
In summary: The 'Start Date/End Date while raising a Request' configuration on an Entitlement Type in Saviynt is </br>
the key to enforcing time-bound access, ensuring that access is granted only for a specific, pre-defined period.

<div>Q42 What is the maximum file attachment limit for a request?　</br>
A. 15</br>
B. 5</br>
C. 10</br>
D. 20</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_042"/>
<div class="hidden_show_042">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
The maximum file attachment limit for a request in Saviynt is typically 10. Here's an explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Access Request System (ARS): The ARS allows users to attach files to access requests to provide supporting documentation or justification.</br>
Attachment Limits: To prevent excessive storage usage and potential performance issues, </br>
Saviynt imposes limits on the number and size of attachments allowed per request.</br>
Default Limit: The default maximum number of attachments allowed per request in Saviynt is generally 10.</br>
Configuration: While 10 is the common default, it's worth noting that this limit might be configurable within the ARS settings </br>
in some Saviynt deployments. However, significantly increasing this limit could impact performance.</br>
File Size Limit: In addition to the number of attachments, there's also usually a limit on the individual file size and </br>
the total size of all attachments combined. This is also generally configurable. </br>
These file size limits are important for maintain system stability and performance.</br>
Error Handling: If a user attempts to exceed the attachment limit, </br>
Saviynt will typically display an error message, preventing them from submitting the request until the number of attachments is reduced.
</div></br>


<div>Q43 Which of the following Access Request configurations can be set up as either optional or mandatory, based on business requirements?</br>
A. Approval comments</br>
B. Add Attachment</br>
C. Business justification at Request level</br>
D. None of the above</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_043"/>
<div class="hidden_show_043">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
In Saviynt's Access Request configurations, the following can be set up as either optional or mandatory based on business requirements:</br>
A. Approval comments: When an approver approves or rejects a request, they can be required to provide comments, or it can be made optional.</br>
B. Add Attachment: Requesters can be allowed or required to attach supporting documentation to their access requests.</br>
C. Business justification at Request level: Requesters can be obligated to provide a business justification for their access request, </br>
or it can be made optional.</br>
Here's a breakdown with Saviynt IGA references:</br>
Saviynt's Access Request System (ARS) Configuration: Saviynt provides granular control over the ARS's behavior, </br>
allowing administrators to customize various aspects of the request process, including data validation and required fields.</br>
Mandatory vs. Optional Fields: Many fields and actions within the ARS can be configured as either mandatory or optional. </br>
This allows organizations to tailor the request process to their specific needs and compliance requirements.</br>
Configuration Locations: These settings are typically found within the ARS configuration section of Saviynt's administrative interface.</br>
Approval Comments: Often configurable within the workflow definition, at the approval step level. </br>
You can define whether comments are required for approval, rejection, or both.</br>
Add Attachment: Generally found under general ARS settings, allowing you to enable or disable attachments and potentially set them as mandatory.</br>
Business Justification: Also found within the ARS settings, allowing you to toggle the requirement for a business justification </br>
at the request level or even at the individual entitlement level.</br>
Business Rationale: The flexibility to make these elements optional or mandatory allows organizations to balance the need </br>
for information with the desire for a streamlined user experience. </br>
For example, high-risk access requests might require detailed justification and attachments, while low-risk requests might not.</br>
Saviynt's Audit Trail: Regardless of whether these fields are mandatory or optional, </br>
Saviynt's audit trail will capture the information provided, ensuring a complete record of the request and approval process.</br>
In summary: Saviynt's ARS allows administrators to configure approval comments, attachments, </br>
and business justifications as either optional or mandatory, providing the flexibility to adapt the access request process </br>
to meet diverse organizational needs and compliance requirements.

<div>Q44 ________ filters the requestable applications under 'Request New Access.'　</br>
A. Access Add Workflow</br>
B. Access Query</br>
C. Provisioning Connection</br>
D. Whom to Request</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_044"/>
<div class="hidden_show_044">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
The component that filters the requestable applications under 'Request New Access' in Saviynt is the Access Query. Here's a detailed explanation:</br>
Saviynt's Access Request System (ARS): As the front end for requesting access, the ARS needs a mechanism to determine </br>
which applications (and entitlements) should be displayed to a user as requestable.</br>
Access Query: This is a powerful feature within Saviynt that allows administrators to define specific criteria </br>
to control the visibility of applications and entitlements in the ARS. Think of it as a filter that determines what a user can see and request.</br>
How Access Queries Work:</br>
Defined on Applications/Entitlements: Access Queries are configured on individual applications or entitlements within Saviynt.</br>
Based on User Attributes: They use user attributes (e.g., department, location, job title, group memberships) and </br>
other criteria (e.g., risk level) to determine if a user should see a particular application or entitlement.</br>
Dynamic Filtering: When a user accesses the 'Request New Access' section, </br>
Saviynt evaluates the Access Queries associated with each application and entitlement in real-time. Based on the user's attributes, the system dynamically filters the list, showing only the applications and entitlements that match the query conditions.</br>
Saviynt's Security Model: Access Queries are a fundamental part of Saviynt's security model. </br>
They ensure that users are only presented with access options that are relevant and appropriate for their role and context, </br>
preventing accidental over-provisioning and reducing the attack surface.</br>
Other Options:</br>
A. Access Add Workflow: While essential for processing access requests, the workflow itself doesn't filter which applications are initially displayed.</br>
B. Provisioning Connection: This relates to how Saviynt connects to target systems for automated provisioning. </br>It doesn't control the initial visibility of applications in the ARS.</br>
D. Whom to Request: This setting might determine the available approvers, but it doesn't filter the list of requestable applications.</br>
In essence: Access Queries act as a dynamic filter, leveraging user attributes and defined criteria to determine which applications </br>
and entitlements are presented to a user within Saviynt's 'Request New Access' interface, ensuring a personalized and secure access request experience.
</div></br>

<div>Q45 Which of the following statuses is applicable for the 'Add Access' task type when the task is successfully completed?　</br>
A. Provisioned</br>
B. Success</br>
C. Manually Provisioned</br>
D. Active</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_045"/>
<div class="hidden_show_045">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
When an 'Add Access' task is successfully completed in Saviynt, the applicable status is typically 'Provisioned.' </br>
Here's a detailed explanation with Saviynt references:</br>
Saviynt's Task Management: Saviynt uses tasks to track the progress of various operations, including access provisioning. </br>
These tasks are generated as part of workflows, such as the 'Access Add Workflow.'</br>
'Add Access' Task Type: This specific task type is created when the access request is approved and </br>
the system is ready to grant the requested access to the target application.</br>
Task Statuses in Saviynt: Saviynt uses different statuses to indicate the current state of a task. </br>
Common statuses include:</br>
Pending: The task is waiting to be processed.</br>
In Progress: The task is currently being executed.</br>
Provisioned: This status signifies that the requested access has been successfully granted to the user in the target system.</br>
Failed: The task encountered an error and could not be completed.</br>
Manually Provisioned: The task was completed manually by an administrator, rather than through automated provisioning.</br>
Success: While sometimes used, this status is less specific than 'Provisioned' in the context of 'Add Access' tasks, </br>
since it does not specify that the action completed was a provisioning action.</br>
Active: Typically applies to accounts or users, not tasks.</br>
Saviynt's Workflow Engine: The workflow engine in Saviynt updates the task status as it progresses through the defined steps.</br>
For connected applications, the workflow engine might directly interact with the target system's API to provision the access.</br>
Once the provisioning is successful, the status is updated to 'Provisioned.'</br>
Saviynt's Audit Trails: Saviynt maintains detailed audit trails, and the task status changes are logged. This provides a clear record of when access was provisioned for a user.</br>
Other Options:</br>
Success: As mentioned above, this is a general status. While technically correct (the task succeeded), 'Provisioned' provides more context.
Manually Provisioned: This status is only applicable if an administrator intervened and manually granted the access outside of the automated workflow.
Active: This status typically pertains to a user or account's overall status, not specifically to the completion of an 'Add Access' task.
</div></br>


<div>Q46 If you want an application to be available for requesting access (self or other), which of the following should be configured?　</br>
A. Proposed Accounts Workflow</br>
B. Access Remove Workflow</br>
C. Access Add Workflow</br>
D. Emergency Access ID Request Workflow</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_046"/>
<div class="hidden_show_046">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
To make an application available for access requests (either self-service or requests for others), </br>
the Access Add Workflow needs to be configured within Saviynt. </br>
This workflow defines the process that governs how access to the application is granted. Here's a breakdown with Saviynt IGA references:</br>
Saviynt's Access Request System (ARS): This is the module within Saviynt that handles access requests. The ARS relies on defined workflows to manage the approval and provisioning process.</br>
Access Add Workflow: This specific type of workflow within Saviynt's ARS is triggered when a user requests access to an application or entitlement. It dictates the steps involved, such as:</br>
Requester Details: Capturing information about who is requesting access.</br>
Application/Entitlement Selection: The user selects the application (and potentially specific roles or entitlements within </br>
that application) for which they are requesting access.</br>
Approval Routing: Defining the approval chain (e.g., manager approval, application owner approval, etc.). </br>
This is configured within the workflow using various approval activities.</br>
Provisioning: Upon approval, the workflow can trigger automated provisioning of access to the target system </br>
(if connected integration is set up).</br>
Saviynt's Application Onboarding: For an application to be available in the ARS, it needs to be onboarded into Saviynt.</br>
During this process, you would typically define the relevant entitlements (access rights) associated with the application.</br>
Workflow Configuration in Saviynt: Saviynt's admin interface allows administrators to create and customize workflows using a visual designer.</br>
This includes setting up conditions, defining approval steps, and configuring actions to be taken at each stage of the workflow.</br>
Other options:</br>
Proposed Accounts Workflow: This is less common, often used to suggest potential accounts during the request or account creation process. </br>
It's not the primary mechanism for making an application available for access requests.</br>
Access Remove Workflow: This workflow is used when access needs to be revoked, not granted.</br>
Emergency Access ID Request Workflow: This workflow is specific to requesting temporary, elevated access in emergency situations.</br>
It's not the workflow for general access requests to applications.</br>
</div></br>


<div>Q47 Marty, an Administrator, reconciled Oracle Accounts into Saviynt. During the import, the incoming accounts were required to be mapped to the existing users in Saviynt. Which of the following Rules should be used to successfully associate Accounts to the correct users?　</br>
A. Account to User Rule</br>
B. Account Name Rule</br>
C. Technical Rule</br>
D. User Account Correlation Rule</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_047"/>
<div class="hidden_show_047">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
User Account Correlation Rules in Saviynt are specifically designed to map imported accounts to existing users within the system. </br>
These rules define the logic for matching accounts to users based on various attributes, such as employee ID, email address, or username.</br>
Why other options are incorrect:</br>
Account to User Rule: This is not a standard rule type in Saviynt.</br>
Account Name Rule: This might focus on naming conventions for accounts, not correlating them to users.</br>
Technical Rule: This is a broader category of rules and doesn't specifically address account-user mapping.</br>
Saviynt IGA Reference:</br>
Saviynt Documentation: The section on Account Correlation Rules provides detailed information on how to configure these rules for different scenarios.</br>
Saviynt Use Cases: Saviynt often provides examples and use cases demonstrating how to use User Account Correlation Rules to automate account mapping during imports.

<div>Q51 Which of the following aspects in EIC is regarded as a unique identity of a person?　</br>
A. Endpoint</br>
B. Employee</br>
C. Account</br>
D. User</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_051"/>
<div class="hidden_show_051">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
In Saviynt, a User represents the unique identity of a person. </br>
It's the central object that ties together all the information about an individual, including their accounts, entitlements, roles, and attributes.</br>
Why other options are incorrect:</br>
Endpoint: Represents a system or application, not a person.</br>
Employee: While many users might be employees, the term 'user' is more general and can include contractors, partners, etc.</br>
Account: Represents a user's access to a specific system, not their overall identity.</br>
Saviynt IGA Reference:</br>
Saviynt Documentation: Throughout the documentation, 'User' consistently refers to the individual's identity within the system.</br>
Saviynt User Interface: The User Management section in Saviynt focuses on managing the lifecycle and access of individual users.
</div></br>


<div>Q52 Accounts, Entitlement types, and Entitlement data of an application are directly associated with: 　</br>
A. Endpoints</br>
B. Roles</br>
C. Workflows</br>
D. Security Systems</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_052"/>
<div class="hidden_show_052">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
In Saviynt, Endpoints represent the systems or applications that Saviynt manages. Accounts, entitlement types, </br>
and entitlement data are all directly associated with these endpoints because they define how access is structured and </br>
granted within those specific systems.</br>
Endpoints as the Foundation: Endpoints are the core objects in Saviynt's identity governance framework. </br>
They provide the context for managing access, as all entitlements and accounts exist </br>
within the context of a specific endpoint (application or system).</br>
Why other options are incorrect:</br>
Roles: Roles are collections of entitlements, but they are not the primary object that accounts and entitlements are directly linked to.</br>
Workflows: Workflows are processes, not the systems or applications themselves.</br>
Security Systems: While related to security, this term is too broad and doesn't specifically refer to the systems being managed.</br>
Saviynt IGA Reference:</br>
Saviynt Documentation: The section on Application Onboarding and Endpoint Management in Saviynt's documentation clarifies the role of endpoints as the central objects for managing access.</br>
Saviynt User Interface: When configuring applications or systems in Saviynt, you define them as endpoints, and all related accounts and entitlements are managed within that endpoint's context.
</div></br>

<div>Q54 Which of the following Application types can be associated with the Automated Provisioning configuration turned OFF? 　</br>
A. Service Desk Application</br>
B. Hybrid Application</br>
C. Connected Application</br>
D. Disconnected Application</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_054"/>
<div class="hidden_show_054">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
Disconnected applications in Saviynt are those that do not have real-time integration with the platform for provisioning and </br>
de-provisioning users. Therefore, automated provisioning would be turned OFF for these types of applications.</br>
Disconnected Applications: These applications typically require manual intervention or custom scripts to manage user access.</br>
Saviynt can still manage entitlements and access requests for these applications, but it doesn't directly provision or de-provision accounts.</br>
Other Application Types:</br>
Service Desk Application: Usually integrated with Saviynt for automated request fulfillment.</br>
Hybrid Application: May have some level of automated provisioning, depending on the specific configuration.</br>
Connected Application: Fully integrated with Saviynt for real-time, automated provisioning.</br>
Saviynt IGA Reference:</br>
Saviynt Documentation: The section on Application Onboarding in Saviynt's documentation explains the different application types </br>
and their integration capabilities, including the concept of disconnected applications.

<div class="hidden_show_055">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
The UIADMIN ROLE in Saviynt grants users the privilege to edit UI (User Interface) labels. </br>
This role is crucial for customizing the Saviynt interface to align with an organization's terminology and branding.</br>
UI Customization: Saviynt allows administrators to modify various UI elements, including labels, </br>
to improve user experience and comprehension. The UIADMIN ROLE provides the necessary permissions for these modifications.</br>
Why other options are incorrect:</br>
The other options are not standard Saviynt roles and do not have any associated privileges for UI label editing.</br>
Saviynt IGA Reference:</br>
Saviynt Documentation: The documentation on Saviynt's administration and configuration settings </br>
includes information about UI customization and the associated UIADMIN ROLE.
Saviynt Support: Saviynt's support resources may contain articles or knowledge base entries </br>
related to UI customization and the permissions required.

<div>Q56 Which of the following Role types should be selected for a Role containing Entitlements that span across multiple applications?　</br>
A. Application Role</br>
B. Transactional Role</br>
C. Enabler Role</br>
D. Enterprise Role</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_056"/>
<div class="hidden_show_056">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
In Saviynt, Enterprise Roles are specifically designed to encompass entitlements that span multiple applications. </br>
This is in contrast to Application Roles, which are limited to entitlements within a single application.</br>
Enterprise Roles: Provide a way to group entitlements across different applications, reflecting a user's overall job function or</br>
 responsibilities within the organization. This is essential for managing access for users who need permissions in various systems to perform their duties.</br>
Other Role Types:</br>
Application Role: Grants permissions specific to a single application.</br>
Transactional Role: Focuses on granting permissions for specific tasks or transactions within an application.</br>
Enabler Role: Provides supplementary permissions that enhance or support other roles.</br>
Saviynt IGA Reference:</br>
Saviynt Documentation: The section on Role Management within Saviynt's documentation clearly defines the different role types and their purposes.</br>
Saviynt Training Materials: Saviynt's training courses emphasize the importance of Enterprise Roles in managing cross-application access.

<div>Q57 Single Sign-On is enabled in EIC using Azure Identity Provider. In this scenario, can the user log in using Azure and EIC native authentication? </br>
A. True</br>
B. False</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_057"/>
<div class="hidden_show_057">
Answer: B</br>
Explanation:</br>
When Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled in Saviynt EIC using an external Identity Provider (IdP) like Azure AD, </br>
it generally becomes the exclusive authentication method. This means users cannot use Saviynt's native authentication </br>
(i.e., logging in with a username/password stored directly within Saviynt).</br>
Reasons for this:</br>
Security and Centralized Control: SSO with an IdP enhances security by centralizing authentication and </br>
enforcing stronger password policies. Allowing native logins would create a potential bypass of these security measures.</br>
User Experience: SSO provides a seamless login experience, eliminating the need for users to remember multiple credentials. </br>
Offering both SSO and native logins could lead to confusion and a less streamlined process.</br>
Administrative Efficiency: SSO simplifies user management by delegating authentication to the IdP. </br>
Administrators don't need to manage separate user accounts and passwords within Saviynt.</br>
Saviynt IGA Reference:</br>
Saviynt Documentation: Saviynt's documentation on SSO configurations emphasizes that enabling SSO typically disables native authentication methods.</br>
Saviynt Best Practices: Saviynt's best practices for SSO recommend enforcing SSO as the sole authentication method for improved security and user experience.</br>
Saviynt Implementation Guides: Implementation guides for setting up SSO with various IdPs, including Azure AD, often highlight the exclusive nature of SSO authentication.

<div>Q58 The Max Authentication Session parameter in Single Sign-On settings specifies the maximum duration, </br>
in seconds, for which an SSO session will remain valid. The default value is 3600 seconds. </br>
If the session logout value defined in IDP is 10,000 seconds and Max Authentication Session in Saviynt SSO is 5000 seconds, </br>
how long will the session last? 　</br>
A. 5000 seconds
B. 10,000 seconds
C. 3600 seconds
D. None of the above
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_058"/>
<div class="hidden_show_058">
Answer: A</br>
Explanation:</br>
In Saviynt's SSO setup, the 'Max Authentication Session' parameter determines the maximum duration of an SSO session within Saviynt,</br>
 overriding any longer durations set by the Identity Provider (IdP).
Session Duration Logic: Saviynt's internal session timeout setting takes precedence over the IdP's session timeout.</br>
This ensures that Saviynt can enforce its own security policies regarding session lifetimes.</br>
Why other options are incorrect:</br>
B. 10,000 seconds: This is the IdP's session logout value, but Saviynt's 'Max Authentication Session' setting overrides it.</br>
C. 3600 seconds: This is the default value, but the question specifies a configured value of 5000 seconds.</br>
Saviynt IGA Reference:</br>
Saviynt Documentation: The documentation for configuring SSO settings within Saviynt explains the 'Max Authentication Session' parameter and</br>
 its impact on session duration.</br>
Saviynt Best Practices: Saviynt's best practices for SSO often recommend aligning session timeouts between the IdP and Saviynt </br>
to avoid confusion and potential security gaps.

<div>Q59 In the process of setting up Single Sign-On using SAML 2.0, the 'SP Entity ID' acts as a unique identifier for the Saviynt SP. </br>
If 'SP Entity ID' is set to the value of SaviyntSP, which of the following will be the correct Single Sign-On URL to log in to EIC?  　</br>
A. https://myorg.saviyntcloud.com/ECM/saml/SSO/SaviyntSP</br>
B. https://myorg.saviyntcloud.com/SaviyntSP</br>
C. https://myorg.saviyntcloud.com/ECM/saml/SSO/alias/SaviyntSP</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_059"/>
<div class="hidden_show_059">
Answer: C</br>
Explanation:</br>
In Saviynt's SAML 2.0 based Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration, </br>
the 'SP Entity ID' uniquely identifies Saviynt as the Service Provider (SP) to the Identity Provider (IdP). </br>
The correct SSO URL structure incorporates this 'SP Entity ID' within a specific path.</br>
Saviynt's URL Structure: Saviynt's SSO URLs follow a pattern to ensure proper routing and authentication. </br>
The /ECM/saml/SSO/alias/ portion is crucial for directing SAML-based login attempts.</br>
Why the other options are incorrect:</br>
A. https://myorg.saviyntcloud.com/ECM/saml/SSO/SaviyntSP: This URL is missing the crucial 'alias' segment in the path, making it invalid for SAML SSO.</br>
B. https://myorg.saviyntcloud.com/SaviyntSP: This URL doesn't include the necessary components for SAML-based authentication within Saviynt.</br>
Saviynt IGA Reference:</br>
Saviynt Documentation: Saviynt's official documentation on configuring SAML SSO provides details on the correct URL structure and the significance of the 'SP Entity ID.'</br>
Saviynt Support: Saviynt's support resources and knowledge base articles often address issues related to SSO configuration, reinforcing the correct URL format

<div>Q60 Which of the following options support Authentication Mechanisms in Saviynt? 　</br>
A. None of the below</br>
B. REST</br>
C. LDAP</br>
D. SAML 2.0</br>
E. Database</br>
<input type="CheckBox" name="name_060"/>
<div class="hidden_show_060">
Answer: D</br>
Explanation:</br>
Saviynt primarily leverages SAML 2.0 as its core authentication mechanism. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an open standard </br>
for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in this case, between users and Saviynt. It allows for secure, single sign-on experiences.</br>
While Saviynt can interact with databases, REST APIs, and LDAP directories for various purposes like identity data aggregation or provisioning, </br>
these are not its primary authentication methods.</br>
Databases: Saviynt can connect to databases to pull identity information, but the platform itself doesn't authenticate users directly against a database.</br>
REST: REST APIs are used for programmatic interaction with Saviynt, not typically for initial user authentication.</br>
LDAP: While LDAP can be a source of identity data, Saviynt's core authentication relies on SAML for its standardized and secure approach.</br>
Key Saviynt IGA references supporting this:</br>
Saviynt Documentation: The official Saviynt documentation consistently refers to SAML as the primary authentication mechanism.</br>
Saviynt Connectors: Saviynt provides pre-built connectors for various identity providers (IdPs) that support SAML, further emphasizing its reliance on this standard.</br>
Saviynt Training Materials: Saviynt's training courses and certifications highlight SAML's role in the platform's authentication framework.
